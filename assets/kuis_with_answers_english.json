        "question": "The module explains the 3 characteristics of Big Data, namely Variety, Velocity and Volume. Name and explain the other 2Vs that have been explained in the module.",
        "answer": "The two additional V's that were explained in the module are Variability and Value. Variability refers to the unpredictable nature of big data, as it can come from a wide range of sources with varying formats, structures, and quality. This makes it challenging to manage and analyze big data effectively. Value refers to the potential benefits that organizations can gain from big data, such as improved decision-making, increased efficiency, and new business opportunities. However, realizing these benefits requires overcoming various challenges, including scalability, business understanding, and regulations and compliance.",

        "answer": "1. Healthcare: Big Data can be used to analyze patient data and medical records to identify patterns and associations that can assist in disease diagnosis, drug development, and more effective and personalized treatment planning. For example, IBM Watson for Oncology uses Big Data to help oncologists make informed decisions about cancer treatment by analyzing patient data and comparing it to the latest research and clinical guidelines. 2. Supply Chain Optimization: Companies operating in the manufacturing or retail industry use Big Data to optimize their supply chains. For example, Walmart uses Big Data analytics to analyze customer demand, inventory, and production processes to identify areas where efficiency can be improved, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction by ensuring the right product is available at the right time.",

        "question": "Mention and briefly explain the characteristics of a data collection called Big Data",
        "answer": "Big Data refers to a large and complex data set that has certain characteristics, often referred to as the \u201c5Vs\u201d. These characteristics are Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value. 1. Volume: Big Data is characterized by its very large size, which can reach petabytes or even exabytes. Examples include data from social media, IoT sensors, online transactions, and others. 2. Velocity: Big Data is generated at a high speed and needs to be processed in real-time or near real-time. Streaming data from social media, online transaction logs, and sensor data are examples where data needs to be analyzed in real-time or near real-time. 3. Variety: Big Data comes in various types and formats, ranging from structured data (such as databases), semi-structured (such as XML, JSON), to unstructured data (such as text, video, and images). This variety adds complexity to data management and analysis. 4. Veracity: Big Data often contains uncertainty, incompleteness, or even errors due to the large volume and variety of data sources. Managing veracity means ensuring the data analyzed is high quality and trustworthy. 5. Value: Big Data has the potential to provide valuable insights and drive strategic decision making. It can assist in disease diagnosis, drug development, supply chain optimization, and more effective and personalized treatment planning.",

        "question": "What is meant by the velocity characteristic?",
        "answer": "The velocity characteristic refers to the rate at which data is generated, processed, and analyzed in a Big Data system. It is an important factor to consider when designing and managing Big Data systems as it affects the scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the system. The velocity of data can vary depending on the source, volume, and complexity of the data, and requires careful planning and optimization to ensure that the system can handle the rapid pace of data generation and analysis.",

        "answer": "1. Purpose: Relational databases are designed to handle daily transactions and operational data (OLTP), while data warehouses are designed for analysis and reporting of historical data from multiple sources (OLAP). 2. Data Structure: Relational databases use a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns, while data warehouses often use a data model such as a star or snow schema that is optimized for querying and analysis. 3. Optimization: Relational databases are optimized for speed and efficiency in processing small to medium data transactions in real-time, while data warehouses are optimized for complex queries and analysis of large amounts of historical data.",
