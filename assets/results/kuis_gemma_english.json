Big Data and analytical technologies now allow us to work with this type of data. Volume often makes up for a lack of quality or accuracy. But all volumes of fast-moving data from a variety of different and truth must be converted into value This is why volume is one of the most important V of big data. 2. Value refers to our ability to transform our data into value. It is important that businesses make a case for any efforts to collect and utilize big data. It's easy to fall into the buzz trap and starting a big data initiative without a clear understanding of the business value will lead to bad results.",

In big data, after processing the data, values \u200b\u200bwill be obtained which are then used to determine the decisions to be taken.",

The character of veracity refers to how accurate and reliable a data is. This aspect concerns the accuracy of data whether it can be trusted or not. With the many forms of data, the truth about information becomes less controlled. Through analysis technology, we can avoid inaccuracies in big data because the larger the volume of data, the less accurate the data will be. 2. Value The value of data determines the decisions we make after processing all the data. Without knowing the value of data, we will have difficulty or even make mistakes in taking the next step.

        "answer": "In the field of nutrition, one of the databases needed is a database regarding the food consumed by clients. This food-related database is usually found in an application for laptops called nutrisurvey. However, the food database in the application is not complete so an input process is required for types of food that are not in the database or foods that have different composition variations in the database. This becomes very troublesome because the input process is only carried out on one nutrisurvey application on one laptop computer. So, when a nutritionist wants to replace a device, or for example, in conditions where it is not possible to bring his or her device, this input process must be done from the start again. Therefore, Big Data can be implemented. The Big Data created is related to food and its composition and caloric value which can later be accessed and edited by all nutrition experts in Indonesia, so that later its use will be easier.",

        "answer": "One example of the application of Big Data can be done at skin care places in Indonesia. Nowadays, many people go to skin care places to beautify their faces and maintain healthy skin. The application of big data can be used to record complaints from patients from different clinics so that services can be faster because they already know the patient's previous history. Apart from that, this big data can be used to record existing medicines in the industry and match them with those in pharmacies. This can be useful for knowing what types of medicines are in the factory, which are already in pharmacies, and which are in the process of being distributed. So it will make it easier to process the product",

        "answer": "1. UNITEDHEALTHCARE: FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE Currently, at least 10% of health insurance payments are related to fraudulent claims. Worldwide, this is estimated to be worth billions of dollars. Fraudulent claims are not a new problem, but the complexity of insurance fraud seems to be increasing exponentially, making it difficult for health insurance companies to deal with it. UnitedHealthCare is an insurance company that provides health benefits and services to nearly 51 million people. The company works with more than 850,000 healthcare workers and approximately 6,100 hospitals nationwide. Their Payment Integrity group is tasked with ensuring that claims are paid correctly and on time. Previously, their approach to managing over a million claims per day, approximately 10 TB of data per day, was ad hoc, highly regulatory, and hampered by fragmented data. UnitedHealthCare\u2019s solution was a dual-mode approach, focusing on allocating savings while also implementing innovation to continue to leverage the latest technology. 2. HADOOP TECHNOLOGY FOR MONITORING PATIENT VITAL CONDITIONS Hadoop is an open source framework or platform based on Java under the Apache license to support applications that run on Big Data. Several hospitals around the world have used Hadoop to help their staff work efficiently with Big Data. Without Hadoop, most healthcare systems would find it nearly impossible to analyze unstructured data. Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta uses bedside sensors to track patient vital conditions such as heart rate, breathing and blood pressure. These sensors can produce very large data and the system is unable to process the data because storing the data requires large storage and costs. In fact, this hospital needs to store vital data for analysis. If there is a change in pattern, a notification is needed for the team of doctors and staff. 3. VALENCE HEALTH: IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY AND REIMBURSEMENTS Valence Health uses Hadoop to build a data lake which is the company's main data storage. Valence processes 3000 inbound data feeds with 45 types of data every day. This critical data includes lab test results, medical record data, prescriptions, immunizations, medications, claims and payments, and claims from physicians and hospitals, which are used to inform decisions on both revenue and reimbursement. Rapid client growth and the associated increase in data volumes are putting a strain on existing infrastructure.",

        "answer": "Google translate is one of the results of implementing the use of big data. Even though it's only a dictionary, Google Translate also takes big data from various articles, posts and online news. This is what allows us to translate a full paragraph into Google Translate -- even though the results are not always accurate. Big data from Google Translate can be seen when there are gender issues in the translation. For example, when translating into English he works at home, it will output SHE works at home, whereas if he works as a lawyer, it will output HE works as a lawyer. SHE and HE who replaced him were obtained not because the developers of Google Translate had problems and gender bias, but rather gender problems that already existed in society, through news, posts and writings which were then used by Google Translate.",

        "answer": "Health sector: -Hadoop is an application of big data for monitoring patient vital conditions. For example, a hospital nurse puts a sensor on a patient's bed to check the patient's vital condition, such as heart rate and blood pressure. Transportation sector: -GPS. Big Data is also applied in the transportation sector, because traffic jams often occur in several big cities in Indonesia. With GPS data owned by city residents' vehicles, it can be converted into speed, acceleration and stopping duration. This conversion data can be used to provide recommendations to the public about the best times to drive and the worst times to travel. Industrial sector: - To avoid the high costs associated with supply chain failure, a company will look for better ways to manage the delivery of raw materials. The industry will decide to use detailed supplier route data, as well as weather and traffic data provided by reliable external sources, to identify possible delivery delays. Using Big Data, they carry out predictive analysis and calculate possible delays and shortages of raw materials. Based on these calculations, companies can make contingency plans regarding inventory and now they can run their production without interruption and of course avoid excessive downtime costs.",

Health One example of implementing big data in the health sector is telemedicine, namely the use of long-distance-based telecommunications media carried out online so that patients can interact with health workers without meeting them in person. This technology can make it easier for health workers to provide care and consultations for patients more effectively and efficiently, both in terms of cost, time and energy. Patients can avoid waiting in queues and doctors can save time in consultations and filling in patient documents. Apart from that, patient data can be viewed directly through the application anytime and anywhere.",

        "answer": "For example, the application of big data in the pharmaceutical sector has been carried out by the SK Group, which has collaborated with various hospitals for 7 years. The large number of hospitals that have collaborated with SK group companies means that many patients undergo examinations and purchase medicines every day. This causes a large potential for errors in drug prescriptions given to patients. Drug prescription errors due to track records regarding the various drugs the patient has taken are very important in determining what drug will be given to the next patient. Because there are so many hospitals, it is difficult to determine the track record of the treatment that patients have received. Therefore, hospitals that are members of the SK Group already use the SIMRS hospital information system which will record all patient data and patient examination data. The aim of implementing Big Data is to analyze patient recap data to help medical staff reduce medication prescription errors.",

It's what the organization does with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves. The characteristics of big data are that it has 6V Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Validity, Volatility and Volume. variety Big Data refers to structured, unstructured, and semistructured data collected from various sources. In the past, data could only be collected from velocity. Velocity basically refers to the speed at which data is generated in real time. veracity data that runs quickly can become data that is biased, abnormal, and too noisy to use immediately. This means that there needs to be a strategy to reduce and process the big data obtained so that it can function. The validity of big data users of course needs to test the validity of the data obtained. Without a doubt, valid data is an important key to making the right decisions. volatility we need to consider the answer to the question of how long the data is valid and how long volatility needs to be displayed. This is related to the velocity aspect where it is very possible to get real time data. Special considerations need to be taken to assess the relevance of the data to the needs of city managers.

        "answer": "In simple terms, a data set to be called Big Data has the following characteristics, namely: The data contained in the data set is very large and continues to grow exponentially over time.  The large amount of data means that the data collection cannot be processed and analyzed using conventional data processing methods.  If data mining, data storage, data analysis, data sharing, and data visualization are used to collect large amounts of data, it is necessary to apply Big Data concepts because the amount is very large. If explained further, several characteristics of a collection of data called Big Data are: Volume means that data can be categorized into Big Data if it has a large size or it is possible that it can grow very quickly so that it requires very large storage.  Variety means that data can be called Big Data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse, including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database.  Velocity means Big Data has the characteristic of changing very quickly both in terms of variables and data types. With these characteristics, a special touch is needed in processing Big Data.  Veracity means Big Data has vulnerabilities in terms of accuracy and validity so it requires depth to analyze Big Data in order to produce the right decisions.  Value means that Big Data has very high value if it is processed in an appropriate way.

Different from ordinary data, Big Data has five special characteristics: variety, now the data that can be used in an analysis process is no longer limited to spreadsheets and databases, now data is present in various forms such as photos, videos, social media posts, emails, pdf, etc. Big data variety refers to how diverse the data is available in a big data system which includes structured, unstructured and semi-structured data velocity basically refers to the speed at which data is created in real time in very large volumes, volume is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Big Data from other database types. Big Data has an exclusive volume attribute where the data volume of a Big Data system is very large. This large volume of data is obtained from the process of collecting data from various sources such as social media, business processes, machines, networks, human interactions, etc. All this very large amount of data is stored in a data warehouse. High value, parameter of the level of usefulness of data in a Big Data system, whether the data can be used to achieve a certain goal or not, veracity, vulnerability to inaccuracy, invalid if not analyzed in depth, parameter to what extent the data in a Big Data system is reliable and trustworthy, several factors influence veracity, including: consistency, data completeness, data integrity, data ambiguity.",

Variety is Big Data which refers to structured, unstructured and semistructured data collected from various sources. Big Data variations have very diverse and varied file forms, including pdf, audio, video, database, or others. 2. Velocity is Big Data which is displayed in the form of data created and can be accessed in real-time by target users. In a broader perspective, it consists of rates of change, correlating data sets coming in at varying rates, and bursts of activity. 3. Volume is Big Data in the form of very large volumes of data that are generated every day from various sources such as social media platforms, business processes, machines, networks, human interactions, etc. which are stored in a data warehouse. 4. Value is the data contained in Big Data, if utilized and processed properly it will become of very high value. 5. Veracity is Big Data which has vulnerabilities in terms of its accuracy and validity, so it requires depth in analyzing Big Data accurately in order to produce decisions that are right on target. Veracity relates to the truth of data so that it can be used as a benchmark for whether it can be trusted or not.",

        "answer": "Characteristics of the data handled by Big Data: Very large volume. Usually the total data size is in terabytes and above.  Velocity data growth is very fast so that data increases in very large amounts in a relatively short period of time.  The form or format of the data varies. The format here can be data in relational database tables such as MySQL, plain text files, Excel files or any form.  Veracity refers to the chaoticness or trustworthiness of the data. With many forms of big data, quality and accuracy are less controlled, for example Twitter posts with hashtags, abbreviations, typos and colloquial speech. Big Data and analytical technologies now allow us to work with this type of data. Volume often makes up for a lack of quality or accuracy. But all volumes of fast-moving data from a variety of different and truth must be converted into value This is why volume is one of the most important V of big data.  Value refers to our ability to transform our data into value. It is important that businesses make a case for any efforts to collect and utilize big data.

        "answer": "This data set has a variety of data forms, has different speeds in connecting incoming velocity data, shows a very large volume of data from various volume sources, has accuracy or veracity validity, and has a value that determines the continuity of value decision making. 1 Variety Variety Big Data refers to structured, unstructured, and semistructured data collected from various sources. In the past, data could only be collected from spreadsheets and databases, now data comes in various forms such as emails, PDFs, photos, videos, audio, SM posts, and more. Variety represents variations in each data that has been obtained through the data reception process. In the process of receiving data you will often encounter various types of data. For example, a database that has been created can accommodate many types of data such as text, audio, video and various other types. In this way, you will get an unstructured data type. With big data, we can group all types of data into a more structured database. 2 Velocity Velocity basically refers to the speed at which data is created in real time. Velocity refers to the speed at which data is entered into a system and has to be processed. In a broader perspective, it consists of rates of change, correlating data sets coming in at varying rates, and bursts of activity. 3 Volume Volume in Big Data shows the enormous volume of data generated every day from various sources such as social media platforms, business processes, machines, networks, human interactions, etc. Large amounts of data are stored in data warehouses. In big data, we need to obtain very large volumes of data from many sources in order to be able to make very good decisions for business purposes. 4 Veracity, big data is about the validity of data, whether it can be trusted or not. It is very important that the validity of data can be trusted and maintained. The abundance of data will be related to the accuracy or validity of that data set. The truth of the information that has been produced cannot be controlled if the data held is invalid. However, Big Data has technology that can be used for analysis so that it will make it easier to overcome data inaccuracies. The more data there is, the more inaccurate the resulting information will be if it is processed incorrectly. 5 Value, The value of data determines the decisions taken after processing all the data. Value really determines the continuity of decision making. Therefore, big data provides search engines that have SEO or search engine optimization to provide recommendations for the search process.",

This aspect refers to structured, unstructured and semistructured data collected from various sources. In big data, there are many very diverse variables that cover various kinds of data in a database. Analysis of this data requires different algorithms for each data, such as text, image, sound and video data. 2. Speed \u200b\u200bVelocity Speed \u200b\u200brefers to the speed at which data is created in real time. Data can be accessed at very fast speeds so that it can be used immediately at that second. 3. Volume Refers to the amount of big data generated every second. The resulting data can be stored on a small to large size scale, from kilobytes to terrabytes. 4. Veracity The character of veracity refers to how accurate and trustworthy the data is. When talking about big data accuracy, what is meant is not only the quality of the data, but how trustworthy the data source is, the type and method of data processing also need to be considered. 5. Value The value of data determines the decisions we take after processing all the data. Big data has very high value if it is processed in an appropriate way or it can also be said how valuable or meaningful the data is. Data that has no value in any part will not be filtered in the big data analysis application system.",

Data warehouse: Data warehouse organizes and processes large amounts of historical data and provides several facilities. Data warehouses store and process data according to different levels of granularity.  Data warehouse systems generally adopt snowflake or star modeling and subject-oriented design.  Data warehouses often span various types of database schemas due to the evolutionary process of an organization. Data warehouses also deal with various information obtained from several other organizations, which combine from various data storage places. This will cause very large volumes so that warehouse data is stored in several storage areas.  The access pattern in the data warehouse is mostly read only.

        "answer": "THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RELATION DATABASE AND DATA WAREHOUSE A relation database is a collection of data in the form of files, archives or tables which are arranged in such a way according to certain rules, connected to each other and stored in electronic media where it is easy for users to manage them and easy to obtain information. A data warehouse is a collection of data originating from various sources stored in a large capacity data warehouse that is used in the decision making process. The difference between database vs data warehouse is explained in detail below: Databases are used in Transactional Online Processing OLTP and can also be used for data warehouse needs Data warehouses are used in Online Analytical Processing OLAP which is able to read historical data for users in the decision making process Tables and combinations in the database very complex so it can reduce redundant data and save storage space.  Tables and joins in the data warehouse are relatively simple to reduce response times and analytical requests.  The database is customer oriented and is used in query and transaction processes, for example by cashiers, sales assistants and IT professionals.  Data warehouses are market oriented and are used in the data analysis process by people who have professional knowledge of the field, for example executives, managers and data analyst experts.  Databases organize and process data in detail so that it is easy to use in the decision making process.  The data warehouse organizes and processes large amounts of historical data and provides several facilities for calculating total sales and combining sales in each area, each month, and so on. Data warehouses store and process data according to different levels of granularity.  Database systems generally adopt data entity relationship modeling and application-oriented design.  Data warehouse systems generally adopt snowflake or star modeling and subject-oriented design.  Databases focus on real time data in an organization or agency without referring to historical data or data from other organizations.  Data warehouses often span various types of database schemas due to the evolutionary process of an organization. Data warehouses also deal with various information obtained from several other organizations, which combine from various data storage places. This will cause very large volumes so that warehouse data is stored in several storage areas.  Access patterns in databases mainly consist of short atomic transactions and systems like this require concurency control and recovery mechanisms.  The access pattern in the data warehouse is mostly read only. This is because most of the data stored is historical data and only a little new data.",

        "answer": "RELATIONAL DATABASE A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each of which is given a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship between several existing values. The Relational Model is the most widely used data model today. This is due to its simple form compared to the network model or hierarchical model. This simple form makes a programmer's job easier, namely in carrying out various data query operations, insert, update, delete, and others. DATA WAREHOUSE Data warehouse is a method for designing databases, which supports the DSSDecission Support System and EIS Executive Information System. Physically, a data warehouse is a database, but the design of a data warehouse and a database is very different. In traditional database design, normalization is used, whereas in a data warehouse, normalization is not the best way. From the definitions explained above, it can be concluded that a data warehouse is a mutually reactive database that can be used for querying and analysis, is subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, does not change and is used to help decision makers.",

        "answer": "A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships. These items are organized into a set of tables with columns and rows. Tables are used to store information about the objects to be represented in the database. Each column in a table contains a specific type of data and fields store the actual values \u200b\u200bof attributes. Rows in a table represent a collection of related values \u200b\u200bfrom a single object or entity. Each row in a table can be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows between multiple tables can be related to each other using foreign keys. This data can be accessed in various ways without restructuring the database table itself. In the relational model, there is a term that plays an important role in designing this type of database, this term is called Relational key. Relational key is one or a combination of several attributes that can uniquely distinguish all rows of data or rows in a table. The types of relational keys include Superkey, Candidate Key, Primary Key Foreign Key and Composite Key. While the data warehouse is a collection of data from various sources stored in a large capacity data warehouse that is used in the decision-making process. Data warehouses are used in Online Analytical Processing OLAP which is able to read historical data for users in the decision-making process. Data warehouse organizes and processes large amounts of historical data and provides several facilities for the purpose of summing up total sales and combining sales in each area, each month, and so on. Data warehouse stores and processes data according to different levels of granularity. Data warehouse systems generally adopt snowflake or star modeling and subject-oriented design. Data warehouses often span multiple types of database schemas due to the evolutionary process of an organization. Data warehouses also relate to various information obtained from several other organizations, which combine from various data storage locations. This will cause a very large volume so that the data warehouse is stored in several storage locations.",

        "answer": "A relational database is a database that stores data in tables consisting of rows and columns. Each row has a primary key and each column has a unique name. Relational database users refer to files as tables, records as rows, and fields as columns. Apart from storing data, this database also stores the relationships contained in the data. In a relational database, we can set or install relationships between tables at any time. The tables must have the same column. The database uses these same columns to create relationships. Many organizations use relational databases to create payroll, accounts payable, inventory, incoming orders, and other business-related matters. Meanwhile, a data warehouse is a large database that stores and organizes the data needed from various sources to analyze transaction history and current transactions as well as to create analytical data about a business. Generally, this data is used to analyze business data from heterogeneous sources. Through a data warehouse, managers and other transaction users can summarize transactions quickly and efficiently. This data can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured data. By combining all the information in one place, an organization can analyze consumers more holistically, thereby increasing sales and profits.",

Data warehouses are used in Online Analytical Processing OLAP which is able to read historical data for users in the decision making process. The tables and combinations in the database are very complex so they can reduce redundant data and save storage space. .  Tables and joins in the data warehouse are relatively simple to reduce response times and analytical requests.  The database is customer oriented and is used in query and transaction processes, for example by cashiers, sales assistants and IT professionals.  Data warehouses are market oriented and are used in the data analysis process by people who have professional knowledge of the field, for example executives, managers and data analyst experts.  Databases organize and process data in detail so that it is easy to use in the decision making process.  The data warehouse organizes and processes large amounts of historical data and provides several facilities for calculating total sales and combining sales in each area, each month, and so on. Data warehouses store and process data according to different levels of granularity.  Database systems generally adopt data entity relationship modeling and application-oriented design.  Data warehouse systems generally adopt snowflake or star modeling and subject-oriented design.  Databases focus on real time data in an organization or agency without referring to historical data or data from other organizations.  Data warehouses often span various types of database schemas due to the evolutionary process of an organization. Data warehouses also deal with various information obtained from several other organizations, which combine from various data storage places. This will cause very large volumes so that warehouse data is stored in several storage areas.  Access patterns in databases mainly consist of short atomic transactions and systems like this require concurency control and recovery mechanisms.  The access pattern in the data warehouse is mostly read only. This is because most of the data stored is historical data and only a little new data.",

Lack of data processing experts. Big Data is a complex concept, so it requires more knowledge in applying the concept of Big Data. This level of difficulty is why there is still a lack of data processing experts who can process Big Data.  The need to emphasize data security. In this modern era, data, especially sensitive data, needs to be secured to avoid cyber hacker attacks. Big Data, which is large amounts of data, raises challenges in terms of security, namely how to secure this large amount of data.  Integrating data from varied sources.

        "answer": "Big Data technology is a relatively new and developing technology. Currently, the focus of Big Data development is still focused on analysis capacity and data storage because these two things are the most important factors in determining the level of effectiveness and success of the Big Data system. This has an impact on the lack of energy and capital used to develop data security, resulting in various cases of data breaches and information theft. Currently, hackers and Big Data security continue to be developed continuously to ensure that systems that use Big Data are safe from data breaches or other forms of information theft and of course this requires quite frequent design changes or code updates. Even though this process takes a lot of time and energy. In addition, along with the times and innovations in the implementation of new technology, the types of data become increasingly diverse, the size of available data will grow exponentially. Moreover, considering that big data management is much different from conventional relational databases, sorting the desired data from the incoming data set is quite difficult.  Data Availability One of the keys to conducting Big Data analysis is of course data availability. Access to data, both old data and new data, can be an obstacle for Big Data, especially old data which is stored in different and varied forms, often in physical form. Access to new data also requires more effort because permits and licenses are required to legally access non-public data. Especially if there is sectoral ego between agencies as data owners. This is what service and information providers who implement Big Data analytics in Indonesia feel, that the data collection phase is the main challenge. In fact, in Indonesia, data for various types of needs is available and abundant, but the sources are scattered, so more effort is needed to obtain integrated data nationally.  Data Privacy On the one hand, data transparency is needed, but on the other hand, privacy is a sensitive issue and is often compromised through technological advances. Privacy relates to a person's personal data that must be protected. Much of the data used as Big Data, which is obtained directly from consumers, is personal data and is very vulnerable to misuse by other parties. When just one data requires guaranteed security, then when there is integration of data from several sources, the level of security must be further increased. Because the data stored is not small, but is related to many things.  Technology This is related to infrastructure and tools in Big Data operations, such as computing and analytical techniques, as well as storage media. It cannot be denied that when you want to utilize Big Data technology, you must also be ready with the technology, such as infrastructure and tools.  Human Resources In applying Big Data technology, human resources are needed with analytical skills and creativity, namely the ability to determine new methods that can be used to collect, interpret and analyze data, computer programming skills, and business skills, namely an understanding of business goals.",

        "answer": "According to Islah 2018, the challenges when implementing Big Data are as follows.  Data availability Access to data can be an obstacle because permits and licenses are required to access non-public data. In Indonesia itself, a lot of data is available, but the data sources are scattered so more effort is needed to obtain the data legally. This is also related to regulations regarding the collection of large amounts of data as regulated in the ITE Law, regulations on electronic system standards, and so on. Standardization of data from the government. Data available in Ministries, Government Institutions and Regional Governments needs to be displayed in a format with certain standards to be able to be used. usable, machine readable, and interoperable.  Data privacy Openness is important, but on the one hand, data privacy is also important when used by other parties. Privacy relates to a person's personal data which must be protected, because it is very vulnerable to misuse by other parties.  HR Competency It requires human resources who are experts in the field of data analysis, have analytical skills, computer programming and creativity to carry out new methods for collecting, interpreting and analyzing data.  Supporting infrastructure. In certain cases, Big Data analysis with Natural Language Processing is needed which can analyze Indonesian digital conversations, which is a challenge in several open source systems.",

With the development of science, the demand for scientists and big data analysis is increasing. It is important for companies to hire someone who has diverse skills because data analysis jobs are multidisciplinary. 2. Data security and privacy. Even though it is very sophisticated and futuristic, potential risks regarding data privacy and security must also be considered when implementing this technology. Big data tools are used for analysis and storage using different data sources. This ultimately leads to a high risk of data exposure. Thus, the increase in the amount of data is directly proportional to the potential risk of security problems. 3. Data storage and quality.

First, as the name implies, the size of big data is very large. Meanwhile, existing technology is not designed to process big data that has low or no locality, is dynamic, large in size, and cannot be loaded into memory. Therefore, in processing big data we must return to statistical methods. Second, data has many variations and dimensions. In other words, data is diverse, heterogeneous, can be structured or unstructured. Then, speed is also a challenge. Data arrives continuously in the form of data streams. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain useful information in real time and determine which data should be stored, which should be discarded. The last challenge is data veracity.

        "answer": "The challenges that exist when implementing Big Data include the rapid growth and development of data so that the tendency to be left behind by this rapid development is very large. Then, when there is a shortage of HR professionals who are experts in their fields, people often cross jobs or take jobs, which causes performance in the use of Big Data to be less than optimal. Also, there are differences in the integration of data sources between one organization and another which makes it a little difficult for agents of change in Big Data to process the necessary data.",

        "answer": "1. Data from various sources is stored on different platforms. A common big data management challenge in a company is the need to manage data from various sources, but the data received is stored on different platforms based on the type of data and the origin of the source. This gap will cause problems during the data collection and analysis process. 2. Classifying quality data. With so much data at their disposal, it will be difficult for employees to classify quality data. In the end, the analysis process does not focus on data that truly has value for the company's business progress. In addition, if employees have to classify quality data manually, then they will not get real-time data to find the latest trends. The inability to see data in real-time will have many significant negative impacts on the quality of decisions taken based on available data or what is usually called data-driven decisions. 3. Lack of employees who have the ability to analyze data. Even though times are increasingly advanced and modern, the reality is that many companies still do not have enough employees to analyze data properly. This problem occurs because the operation of the platform is complex, only certain employees can be relied on to analyze data. If the situation is like this, it will be difficult for companies to keep up with the pace of development of business competition, because the data analysis process takes a very long time. 4. Requires a lot of costs. The next big data management challenge is the large costs required to carry out an effective data analysis process. 5. Scalability problems As the company's business develops, the amount of data that will be produced will become increasingly uncontrollable. The increasing amount of data will create new problems in storing and managing data, because the process will become more complex. Many companies fail to manage their data effectively as their business grows. The big data analytics platform that has been used since the beginning does not have good enough capabilities to manage increasingly large amounts of data.",

Ignoring this can create gaps and lead to the wrong messages and insights.  LACK OF PROFESSIONALS WHO UNDERSTAND BIG DATA ANALYSIS. With the exponential increase in data, the demand for big data scientists and analysts is growing. It is important for companies to hire a data scientist who has diverse skills because the work of a data scientist is multidisciplinary.  GET IMPORTANT INSIGHTS THROUGH BIG DATA ANALYSIS. It is very important for companies that only relevant departments have access to this information. Real-time data can help researchers and companies provide the latest insights for decision making.  GETTING VOLUMES OF DATA INTO A BIG DATA PLATFORM. Companies need to handle large amounts of data every day. The amount and variety of data available today can overwhelm data engineers and it is critical to make data accessibility easy and convenient for company owners and managers.  UNCERTAINTY IN LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT DATA. With the emergence of big data, new technologies and companies, the big challenge faced by companies in big data analysis is to know which technology is most suitable for them without new problems and potential risks.  DATA STORAGE AND QUALITY. Popular data storage options such as data lakes warehouses are generally used to collect and store large amounts of unstructured and structured data in their native format. Missing data, inconsistent data, logic conflicts, and duplicate data all result in data quality challenges.  DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY. Big data also involves potential risks regarding data privacy and security. Big data tools are used for analysis and storage using different data sources. This ultimately leads to a high risk of data exposure and makes it vulnerable.

        "answer": "1. Big data processing requires special software with different coding or syntax. Therefore, companies need data practitioners who are not cheap. 2. Need to synchronize different data sources. As data sets become larger and more diverse, there is a big challenge to combine them into a platform. If this is ignored, it will create gaps and lead to wrong messages and insights. 3. Uncertainty in the data management landscape. With the emergence of big data, new technologies and companies, the big challenge faced by companies in big data analysis is to find out which technology is the best fit for them without introducing new problems and potential risks. 4. Data storage and quality. Popular data storage options such as data lakes warehouses are generally used to collect and store large amounts of unstructured and structured data in their original formats. Missing data, inconsistent data, logical conflicts, and duplicate data all create data quality challenges. 5. Data security and privacy. Big data also involves potential risks regarding data privacy and security. Big data tools are used for analysis and storage using different data sources. This ultimately leads to a high risk of data exposure and makes it vulnerable. The increase in the amount of data also increases privacy and security concerns.",

        "answer": "1. Data from various sources is stored on different platforms. A common big data management challenge in a company is the need to manage data from various sources, but the data received is stored on different platforms based on the type of data and the origin of the source. If the situation is like that, the analysis of the data analysis results will tend to be ineffective because its completeness and accuracy will need to be questioned. 2. Difficult to classify quality data. With the large amount of data they have, it will be difficult for employees to classify quality data. In the end, the analysis process does not focus on data that truly has value for the company's business progress. 3. Requires a lot of costs. The next big data management challenge is the large costs required to carry out an effective data analysis process. 4. Scalability problems As the company's business develops, the amount of data that will be produced will become increasingly uncontrollable. This can also be called velocity, which refers to the speed of growth or increase in big data that cannot be controlled so that it is difficult for us to process this data with conventional technology. The increasing amount of data will create new problems in storing and managing data, because the process will become more complex.",

Some come from company applications, social media streams, email systems, employee-created documents and so on. We must be able to combine all the data and carry out reconciliation so that we can create difficult data reports. 3. shortage of professional staff. The challenge in implementing Big Data technology is the shortage of professional staff. With the exponential increase in data, the demand for Big Data analysis experts will be even greater. It is also important for companies to be able to employ skilled data experts who also have good data analysis skills and have high discipline. 4. data fragmentation In companies data is fragmented. Each department or section or unit stores its own data. There is no special department which handles the management of all data and ensures correctness, consistency or updates.

        "answer": "First, as the name suggests, the size of big data is very large. Meanwhile, existing technology is not designed to process big data that has low locality or no locality, is dynamic, large in size, and cannot be loaded in memory. Therefore, in processing big data we have to return to statistical methods. Second, data has many variations and dimensions. In other words, data is diverse, heterogeneous, can be structured or unstructured. Then, speed is also a challenge. Data arrives continuously in the form of a data stream. Therefore, it is difficult to get useful information in real time and determine which data should be kept and which should be discarded. The final challenge is the correctness of the data. A lot of data changes all the time, so the truth of the data becomes uncertain.",
