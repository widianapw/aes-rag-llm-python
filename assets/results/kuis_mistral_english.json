In a database, tables and relationships are complex due to normalization for RDMS, which reduces redundant data and saves storage space. The relational modeling technique is used to design the RDMS database.\n\nDatabase Optimization:\nThe database is optimized for writing operations. In a database, low performance is observed for query analysis in data warehousing (OLAP). A data warehouse is used for online analytical processing (OLAP) to read historical data for business decisions. The tables and relationships in the data warehouse are simple because they are denormalized. This is done to reduce response time for analytical queries. The technique of data modeling is used to design the data warehouse, which is optimized for reading operations. High performance is observed for analytical queries in the data warehouse.",

        "answer": "Data warehouse is a comprehensive storage and processing system for various sources of data, not just relational databases that are integrated and easy to display information in a drill-down or roll-up manner. In general, the process of data warehousing involves:\n1. Online transaction process (OLTP) database with characteristics such as being normalized, changeable, real-time, large, and capable of handling various data sources like flat files, DBMS, etc.\n2. Data warehouse stage where data is not queried in large quantities and is not normalized, but has been aggregated according to the needs of report analysis and denormalized due to business reasoning. If data needs to be queried with many JOIN processes like in OLTP databases, the process becomes heavy. Large OLTP data.\nData warehouse is an aggregation of various types of data sources that are different.",

        "answer": "The need for synchronization of different types of data sources due to the large and diverse nature of the data chain, making it a challenge to integrate them into a single platform. The lack of professional expertise in big data analysis is also a challenge. Data security and privacy are also concerns, as well as the tools used for big data analysis and storage using different data sources. The speed of data flow is also a challenge. Data that arrives continuously in the form of a data stream makes it difficult to obtain real-time information and determine which data should be stored and which should be discarded. The uncertainty of data accuracy due to frequent changes makes it unpredictable.",

        "answer": "1. The first challenge is working with data growth. The amount of information stored in the world today has increased by twofold in just two years.\n2. The variety of Big Data sources will lead to challenges in integrating and reconciling data to create reports that are difficult. Big Data sources come from various applications, social media flows, email systems, employee documents, and others. The challenge is to combine all the data and perform reconciliation to make it possible to create complex reports.\n3. The right time for understanding: 4. The challenge in implementing Big Data technology is a lack of professional expertise. With the exponential increase in data, the demand for Big Data analysts will continue to grow. It is also important for companies to have skilled data analysts who can work effectively and have good analytical skills, as well as high discipline.\n5. Fragmentation of data: In a company, data is fragmented across departments or units. Each department or unit stores its own data. There is no specialized department that manages all the data and ensures accuracy, consistency, and updates. The type of data is what will prevent your business from understanding the complexity of the problems that arise.",
