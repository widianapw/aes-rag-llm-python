Meanwhile, according to Mc Leod and Schell, artificial intelligence is the activity of providing machines such as computers with the ability to display behavior that is considered as intelligent as if the ability was displayed by humans. It can be said that AI is a computer system that is programmed to be able to do human work. AI itself is a technology that requires data to be used as knowledge, just like humans. AI needs experience and data so that its intelligence can be even better. Important points in the AI \u200b\u200bprocess are learning, reasoning and self-correction. AI needs to learn to enrich its knowledge. The AI \u200b\u200blearning process is not always told by humans, but AI will learn by itself based on AI's experience when used by humans.

        "answer": "AI is an acronym for Artificial Intelligence. What is artificial intelligence? What is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence is one of the results of human creation whose function is to create a system mindset, where the system attempts to imitate the way humans process systems. This thought system is usually integrated by something to make it easier for humans to carry out their activities. Just like the brain, AI must learn first. They also have a mind bank just like the human brain which must be filled with knowledge first before it is finally processed and put into practice into a system. The advantage of AI is that it learns much faster than humans. If humans are only able to learn something at a time, then AI will duplicate it. For example, humans learn a chess move today 1 time in half an hour. AI also performs the same chess move today. Tomorrow, humans learn 1 more chess move. Meanwhile, AI has learned two chess moves, why? Because the chess moves that AI learned yesterday can be done simultaneously with the moves learned today. In one day, AI already has 2 steps ahead of humans. AI's weakness is its control and lack of feelings. They can continue to learn, and because they continue to learn, AI will surpass humans as creators. If humans are exceeded, then the only way to overcome this weakness is to turn off the system containing the AI \u200b\u200bor, make it strict for the AI \u200b\u200bto be able to learn and function according to the initial purpose of its creation.

        "answer": "The application of AI in e-commerce improves the quality of the platform as well as the customer experience. For example, in a product search, when a visitor types Red Bag, they will get a list of red bags instantly. This is made possible by the underlying AI algorithm, which regularly categorizes product searches for efficient indexing. In addition, by paying attention to customer usage patterns, this technology can also recommend products and assist searches.

In addition, by paying attention to customer usage patterns, this technology can also recommend products and assist searches. -Definition: Artificial intelligence or Artificial Intelligence AI is a simulation of human intelligence that is modeled in a machine and programmed to think like humans. In other words, AI is a computer system that can do jobs that generally require human power or human intelligence to complete the job. AI itself is a technology that requires data to become knowledge, just like humans. AI needs experience and data so that its intelligence can be even better. The important points in the AI \u200b\u200bprocess are learning, reasoning and self-correction. AI needs to learn to enrich its knowledge. The AI \u200b\u200blearning process is not always directed by humans, but AI will learn by itself based on AI experience when used by humans. -Examples of Artificial Intelligence: 1. SMART CARS One application of AI technology that makes human activities easier can be seen from smart cars. for example, smart cars produced by Tesla. This car is equipped with an AI or artificial intelligence technology chip, which can make this car run several sensors. Some of these sensors can run the radar system for the autopilot feature.  2. CHATBOTS In business, especially in the digital era, chatbots have many roles. Apart from being a service and information center 24 hours a day, this technology indirectly influences sales. This is because all customer information that interacts with the chatbot is recorded. Based on these records, the company will get the person's email, telephone number, age, gender and habits. This data collection will be processed to be used as marketing strategy material. The approach can be through newsletters, product recommendations, or discounts. 3. APPLICATION OF AI IN E-COMMERCE The application of AI in e-commerce improves platform quality and customer experience.

K-Mean Clustering Unsupervised Learning Machine Learning AI K-Mean Clustering is a statistical classification method that can classify an object based on the clusters that have been given. K-Mean Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning that is part of machine learning. The use of machine learning certainly cannot be separated from training data and test data, the system will be trained first so that it can classify objects correctly later. 2. SVM Support Vector Machine Supervised Learning Machine Learning AI SVM is a method in supervised learning which is usually used for classification such as Support Vector Classification and Support Vector Regression regression. In classification modeling, SVM has a more mature and mathematically clearer concept compared to other classification techniques. SVM can also solve linear and non-linear classification and regression problems. 3. VR Virtual Reality Virtual reality works by manipulating the human brain so that various virtual things feel like real things.

        "answer": "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI is artificial intelligence from a branch of science in the field of computers, the content of which emphasizes human thinking and working patterns, development in terms of machine intelligence, etc. or a simulation of the intelligence possessed by humans which is modeled in machines. and programmed to think like humans. Examples of AI: 1, Siri A personal assistant system from Apple found on the iPhone and iPad is called Siri. This personal assistant is in the form of a woman's voice which can be activated with a friendly voice, and is able to interact directly with daily routines. Siri will help you with sending messages, opening applications, finding information, adding events to the calendar, giving directions, and opening voice calls automatically. This series also uses a sophisticated machine system and is able to obtain questions and understand them well. 2. Facebook's DeepFace. One example of AI is the DeepFace technology owned by Facebook. This AI functions to recognize the faces of people in photo posts. With this technology, you no longer need to manually tag someone in the photo, because AI will do it. AI can identify that the person in the photo is you, AI will be trained based on the data. The data is obtained when you tag people in the previous photo and from the results of AI suggestions for people in the photo that you approve. After the AI \u200b\u200btrains and has a lot of data, the AI \u200b\u200bwill be able to identify someone in the photo. 3. Tesla Not only is it found in smartphones, but cars also have this artificial intelligence technology. AI can be found in cars that have many awards, because they have sophisticated features, for example having the ability to predict things, self-driving and even absolute technological innovations. The car that has artificial intelligence is Tesla. This sophisticated car is suitable for those of you who have dreams like the cars in Hollywood films. 4. E-Commerce Recommendations One of the concepts of applying AI that you often encounter is product recommendations in e-commerce. Maybe you have shopped at an e-commerce site and when you shopped there were products recommended for you. AI obtains data from you yourself, for example when you search for a product, purchase a product and have seen any products. This data will be processed from the AI \u200b\u200bconcept, namely data mining, so that AI will recommend products that are right for you.",

        "answer": "Artificial Intelligence is artificial intelligence created to simulate human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. This process includes learning, decision making, and self-correction. Specific applications of AI include expert systems e.g., Google Maps, speech recognition e.g. Apple's Siri and machine vision e.g. Facebook's facial recognition. Artificial Intelligence is actually a concept that has existed since Ancient Greece. Even though the concept of AI has existed since ancient times, AI was only developed in the mid-20th century. Several experts define the meaning of AI. Artificial Intelligence does not only take the form of robots that can resemble humans. In general, there are 3 types of technology that are classified as Artificial Intelligence, namely. 1. Symbol-manipulating AI This type of Artificial Intelligence works with abstract symbols. This type of AI experiment can be said to be the most numerous when compared to other types of AI. The form of the experiment is that humans will be rearranged at hierarchical and logical levels. 2. Neural AI This type of Neural AI has been popular since the late 1980s among most computer scientists. By using this type of AI, knowledge will not be generated through symbols, but will be generated through an artificial brain. The knowledge that has been collected will be divided into neurons and after that will be connected into several groups. 3. Neural Networks This type of Neural Network works with layers that are connected to each other through simulation. At the top layer is the input layer which can function as a sensor. This sensor can be useful as a receiver of information which will later be processed into the system. At the very bottom of neural networks there is an output layer which has a very small number of neurons. 3 Examples 1. Virtual Assistants There are many examples of platforms or hardware that provide virtual assistant-based technology, for example Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Siri, and others. The task of this virtual assistant is to be able to record any information you need, as well as provide information related to the time of your event. Apart from that, virtual assistants can also be used to play music, send messages, open applications and other advanced features. And the most interesting feature is the ability to find out what you like and provide recommendations for content that you often watch or access on the internet. 2. Facebook Deepface The second example, developed by the giant company Facebook, has a feature to detect and recognize faces in photo posts. With this technology, you don't need to bother marking photos manually. AI can recognize faces based on the data it has obtained, which comes from recommendations or suggestions when you approve a photo that has been successfully tagged. 3. Recommendations for eCommerce. You often encounter this third implementation example when carrying out an online buying and selling transaction via a website or marketplace platform. Have you noticed that when you look at products, after a few moments recommendations search results will appear for the product you have been looking for? Well, this is the result of observations made by AI to help you find information on products or goods that you currently need. The concept of this search comes from data mining which has been successfully applied to artificial intelligence.",

        "answer": "Artificial intelligence or Artificial Intelligence AI is a simulation of human intelligence that is modeled in a machine and programmed to think like humans. Meanwhile, according to Mc Leod and Schell, artificial intelligence is the activity of providing machines such as computers with the ability to display behavior that is considered as intelligent as if this ability were displayed by humans. In other words, AI is a computer system that can do jobs that generally require human power or human intelligence to complete the job. AI itself is a technology that requires data to become knowledge, just like humans. AI needs experience and data so that its intelligence can be even better. The important points in the AI \u200b\u200bprocess are learning, reasoning and self-correction. AI needs to learn to enrich its knowledge. The AI \u200b\u200blearning process is not always directed by humans, but AI will learn by itself based on AI experience when used by humans. What is quite interesting about AI is that it is capable of self-correction or correcting itself. If you've ever heard the expression AI If I never win, then at least I can't lose, it's a little scary too. AI is programmed to continue learning and improving itself from the mistakes it has made. Examples of AI: 1. Facebook Deepface One example of AI is the DeepFace technology owned by Facebook. This AI functions to recognize the faces of people in photo posts. With this technology, you no longer need to manually tag someone in the photo, because AI will do it. Maybe you are wondering, how does the AI \u200b\u200bknow that the person in the photo is you. You need to know that before the AI \u200b\u200bcan identify that the person in the photo is you, the AI \u200b\u200bwill be trained based on data. The data is obtained when you tag people in the previous photo and from the results of AI suggestions for people in the photo that you approve. After the AI \u200b\u200btrains and has a lot of data, the AI \u200b\u200bwill be able to identify someone in the photo. 2. E-Commerce Recommendations One of the concepts of applying AI that you often encounter is product recommendations in e-commerce. Maybe you have shopped at an e-commerce site and when you shopped there were products recommended for you. The recommended products are not from someone who predicts what you might buy. These recommended products are the result of an AI process. Then where does AI get the products that will be recommended? AI gets data from you yourself, for example when you search for products, purchase products and you have seen what products. This data will be processed from the AI \u200b\u200bconcept, namely data mining, so that AI will recommend products that are right for you. 3. Virtual Assistant The next example of artificial intelligence is a virtual assistant, there are many virtual assistant providers such as Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa. Like assistants in general, you can also interact with this virtual assistant. Apart from that, the virtual assistant can record when you have an appointment or event and provide information when the specified event time arrives. You can also command this virtual assistant to send messages, play music, open applications and so on. This virtual assistant will also continue to learn as you use it, so the virtual assistant can know what you like and what things you usually do. In fact, there are many more examples of the application of AI, such as the AI \u200b\u200bfeature of the camera on a smartphone which can make camera settings according to current conditions. Or the AI \u200b\u200bfrom the Tesla car which is able to run without a driver.",

This is because these systems have been designed to have human abilities such as learning, making decisions, and correcting errors, and even tend to be more accurate than humans with the presence of Big Data. Apart from that, computers and machines are also considered more capable of organizing data in larger quantities and faster than human capabilities. Therefore, as humans we are required to be more open and more innovative so as not to be unable to compete with digitalized machines.",

        "answer": "I think service jobs can be replaced by AI. There is evidence such as hotels with robot receptionists in Japan and others. This can happen because the work is repetitive, the cases faced by customer service are the same cases almost every time, therefore AI can be programmed to deal with cases that are generally experienced. Apart from that, CS work is not a job that requires morals, unlike police, judges, or others, which require building a moral machine, CS only faces general problems without needing to think about morals.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature will one day be replaced by machines, but humans still have to be present in these jobs as supervisors of the working machines because there are some parts that cannot be replaced by machines. My reason that repetitive work will be replaced by machines is that existing machines are very programmable, they can be given a program algorithm to be able to carry out a task continuously. With AI, machines can continue to improve their functions so that the repetitive tasks they have can become very effective and efficient. Apart from that, with Big Data Data analytics, AI functions can be helped even more because information about what the machine has done can be stored and analyzed into data that can be used to upgrade existing algorithms. Meanwhile, my reason that human calm will still be used, even if only as a supervisor, is because some jobs such as customer service require individual review, namely the ability to understand the biases and emotions that humans have because no matter how sophisticated the machines are, they are still unable to recognize the line. emotional and psychological grayness of humans. A clear example of this is the re-checking of YouTube videos by YouTube employees which had previously been blocked by AI when the uploader claimed that their videos did not violate YouTube rules.",
