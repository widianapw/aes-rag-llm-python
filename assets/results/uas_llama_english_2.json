This is because currently various technologies have developed, especially in the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 towards 5.0 which is increasingly digitalizing society. Various technologies such as the Internet of Things IoT and Artificial Intelligence AI already exist and have various capabilities that can compete with human abilities which are repetitive in nature.

However, this does not mean that AI customer service will completely replace human interaction in the field of customer service. How a company treats its customers is very important in building its reputation and engagement rate. AI tools can quickly resolve high-urgency situations quickly, but when it comes to scenarios that require high levels of emotion, no AI can mimic human empathy, so there are still advantages to having real people helping customers.

        "answer": "I think service jobs can be replaced by AI. There is evidence such as hotels with robot receptionists in Japan and others. This can happen because the work is repetitive, the cases faced by customer service are the same cases almost every time, therefore AI can be programmed to deal with cases that are generally experienced.

        "answer": "In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature will one day be replaced by machines, but humans still have to be present in these jobs as supervisors of the working machines because there are some parts that cannot be replaced by machines. My reason that repetitive work will be replaced by machines is that existing machines are very programmable, they can be given a program algorithm to be able to carry out a task continuously. With AI, machines can continue to improve their functions so that the repetitive tasks they have can become very effective and efficient. Apart from that, with Big Data Data analytics, AI functions can be helped even more because information about what the machine has done can be stored and analyzed into data that can be used to upgrade existing algorithms. Meanwhile, my reason that human calm will still be used, even if only as a supervisor, is because some jobs such as customer service require individual review, namely the ability to understand the biases and emotions that humans have because no matter how sophisticated the machines are, they are still unable to recognize the line. emotional and psychological grayness of humans. A clear example of this is the re-checking of YouTube videos by YouTube employees which had previously been blocked by AI when the uploader claimed that their videos did not violate YouTube rules.",

Because it cannot be denied that one day people will increasingly want everything to be automatic and practical.

        "answer": "Customer Service jobs are jobs that only require certain skills. If machines took over this job, there would likely be many incompatibilities. Humans are basically creatures who have feelings and have the ability to improvise. AI in customer service is a mistake, because it requires human power who is able to improvise. The order given to the AI \u200b\u200bis only one at a time, if the order is changed then the decision is void because it does not match the initial order. Meanwhile, if a human is the customer service person, the order can be changed without having to negate the previous order. Additionally, in AI practice. The grammar used is grammar that is appropriate to the book. Sometimes humans don't need that, but how can customer service adapt to human needs without being too rigid like a machine? Work will never be able to be replaced 100 times by machines, there are still human hands as translators of the shortcomings and stiffness of a machine.",

        "answer": "The role of customer service is to resolve problems when there are complaints or questions from consumers. Usually we will be connected and can talk directly with them, after calling and pressing a certain button. Reportedly this AI will start to replace the original role of CS. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that consumers frequently ask and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. Data from the MIT Technology Review sponsored by Genesys shows that 91 iconic companies with the highest levels of customer experience CX - customer experience and world-class brand recognition use AI solutions to increase their customer satisfaction, compared to 42 other companies operating in the same field. the same overall. If we take a quick look at this, it will make things easier for customers. This AI can work 24 hours without stopping. Customers will be satisfied and don't need to wait until CS work time if they want to complain or question a problem. And the longer AI works, the more data it stores and the smarter AI becomes at serving customers. However, if some customers are not satisfied with the service from AI, usually applications that use AI provide Real Customer Service alternatives. Therefore, in my opinion, over time Customer Service jobs will be replaced little by little because I am sure that over time AI will be much more developed than what we see now.",

        "answer": "The role of customer service is to resolve problems when there are complaints or questions from consumers. Usually we will be connected and can talk directly with them, after calling and pressing a certain button. Reportedly this AI will start to replace the original role of CS. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that consumers frequently ask and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. If we take a quick look at this, it will make things easier for customers. This AI can work 24 hours without stopping. Customers will be satisfied and don't need to wait until CS work time if they want to complain or question a problem. Is it enough to just stay there? If you look at it, it looks like this CS will slowly be replaced by this robot. However, will it be completely replaced? If I look at the role of CS, which is the recipient and solver of problems, it still requires interaction. However, robots with AI will carry out tasks according to the command code that has been set in the artificial brain.

        "answer": "These jobs can be replaced by machines, namely by using AI. In his lecture on AI, Mr. Sunu explained that currently there are algorithms that can create artificial sounds from human voices. It was even shown in the video of Mr. Sunu's lecture that an image can speak like a human. Even though it is purely machine-made. For jobs such as customer service, it is certainly similar to this. AI is also a way to automate various things. With AI and machine learning, the more data input, the more accurate the output you get. For example, they can replace the cashier's job with a machine with an image sensor, so it can recognize goods and prices. So the machine can immediately calculate and package automatically.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, CS Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive services can one day be replaced by machines. The reason I think like that is because in an era where technology has developed rapidly, repetitive or repeated work such as CS can be replaced with machines that have AI artificial intelligence. Apart from that, by using robots the work will be more efficient because it has smaller errors compared to errors that can be made by humans. Apart from that, in the future, machines equipped with AI will become widespread and are inexpensive, which does not rule out the possibility that companies will prefer machines because they require cheaper costs and a higher success rate compared to having to pay humans monthly.",

        "answer": "Customer service can be replaced by machines. Developers can create applications to receive questions and criticism from consumers. A collection of frequently asked questions can be managed by categorizing, making it easier for customers to find answers to the problems they face. Applications can be implemented on smartphones or developed as websites to make them more easily accessible to customers. The work scheme can be described as follows. Customers have an ID in the form of a name or user number which is used to enter the system and functions as the customer's identity to convey criticism or questions that require follow-up. Then there is an option that directs customers to be more specific about the problems they are experiencing. The system will process customer data and then provide output answers to problems. If the problem requires follow-up from the store, the customer will be given directions for further action. For example, if a complaint about product quality results in a product replacement, the customer is directed to return the product to a special place and get a replacement product.",

        "answer": "Yes, because with the ongoing development of AI, a system can be created that can have equal or greater intelligence than humans, AGI and ASI. Examples of existing changes include robot waiters in restaurants or automatic cashiers. AI can be set to carry out existing work tasks so that it can replace the role of humans in carrying out the work. With these changes, the jobs being replaced will also be helped and can become more efficient. However, of course, in its development, in-depth research is needed so that errors do not occur during practice.",

Apart from that, there are also applications that can recognize and answer our commands via chat, such as bots or the simi-simi application. Even though currently there are still many errors in these two types of AI applications or there are often misinterpretations, it is possible that in the future these two AI applications can replace customer service jobs and other jobs where the nature of the service is repetitive with several system developments and improvements.",

        "answer": "In the era of industrial revolution 4.0, many human jobs can be replaced by robots or AI artificial intelligence. Repetitive and rote work has begun to be eroded by the development of automation, robots and artificial intelligence technology. However, there are some human skills that cannot be replaced by machines, such as empathy, creativity, and analytical skills for complex problems. The role of customer service is to resolve problems when there are complaints or questions from consumers. However, sometimes the problems that AI can answer are only general command problems. If a customer has a complex problem, which requires problem analysis skills, of course human customer service is needed. So currently the role of CS can only be partially replaced by AI, but still requires human supervision. One day, technology is needed that can engineer the ability to empathize and analyze previous complex problems to apply the role of CS with machines as a whole.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, service jobs can be replaced by machines. This is because using machines requires lower costs, reduces the consequences of human error, makes the work process faster and so on. This can increase the effectiveness of using machines rather than workers. For example, in America there is a company that is engaged in construction and uses machines to do their work. The construction of the house can be completed in less than 24 hours, whereas if you use workers the time will take longer which ultimately leads to spending more money. However, there are some jobs that cannot be replaced by machines, in my opinion these are jobs such as a politician, painter, filmmaker, writer, inventor and so on. This is because this work uses abstract human intelligence and in my opinion cannot be applied in machines because the process is very difficult and cannot be explained.",

        "answer": "Customer Service's main job is to interact with consumers in the form of answering several questions and helping solve consumer problems. Usually there are questions that consumers frequently ask, so looking at the pattern of these events, one day this CS job could be replaced by an AI machine. AI can be set to answer several questions and problems that consumers frequently ask and respond based on the responses that we can set. By using AI, CS work will be replaced and consumers will feel satisfied because this performance is valid for 24 hours. However, the role of CS cannot be completely replaced by machines because a service still requires interaction. For example, if there are questions outside of general problems that often occur, this may not be able to be responded to by the robot appropriately, so the role of CS must remain until AI is truly developed optimally.",

        "answer": "The role of customer service is to resolve problems when there are complaints or questions from consumers. Usually we will be connected and can talk directly with them, after calling and pressing a certain button. Currently, AI is starting to replace the original role of CS. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that consumers frequently ask and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. If we take a quick look at this, it will make things easier for customers. This AI can work 24 hours without stopping. Customers will be satisfied and don't need to wait until CS work time if they want to complain or question a problem. Based on this, it seems possible that CS will slowly be replaced by robots. If I look at the role of CS, who is a recipient and problem solver, it still requires interaction. However, robots with AI will carry out tasks according to the command code that has been set in the artificial brain. But what happens if a consumer asks questions about general problems that rarely occur? Maybe the robot will be confused. Therefore, in my opinion, CS work will still persist until the AI \u200b\u200bdeveloped is truly optimal.",

        "answer": "In my opinion CS jobs can be replaced by machines in the future. because nowadays technology is increasingly sophisticated and developing rapidly. According to the news I read, AI will start to replace the original role of CS. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that consumers frequently ask and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. If we take a quick look at this, it will make things easier for customers. This AI can work 24 hours without stopping. Customers will be satisfied and don't need to wait until CS work time if they want to complain or question a problem. However, not all robots can answer customer questions. However, there are also many high-ranking officials who do not agree with replacing CS with robots because this could cause even more unemployment in Indonesia. but now technology is really needed and well developed and technology also coexists with humans.",

In fact, currently in several places robots are being used as a substitute for customer service or parking services that use parking printing machines. However, based on my understanding, it takes a long time to reach this changeover stage. This is because a new technology that has been produced will undergo reinforcement training, where this technology must undergo several trainings and will later receive rewards or penalties for trial and error which will then be updated on the machine.

Because seeing the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, the Customer Service system is repetitive so it can be replaced by machines. The Artificial Intelligence system will answer consumer problems and provide responses to problems often raised by customers. AI will then function according to the command code that has been set in its artificial brain. Artificial intelligence that may be used in machine learning. System patterns that can be utilized include searching, perception, the aim of which is to perceive each incoming stimulus, the stimulus can be in the form of audio, video, and planning the pattern of the stimulus data set that will be input so that it can predict the same pattern and then be able to provide appropriate answers to customers.",

        "answer": "Yes, you can if the AI \u200b\u200bbeing developed is very optimal. Due to the rapid development of AI Customer Service and the repetitive nature of service work, one day it will be replaced by machines. AI will begin to replace the original role of CS and is set to be able to answer various problems frequently asked by consumers and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. AI will carry out tasks according to the command code that has been set in its artificial brain. However, if there are consumers who ask questions about general problems that rarely occur. It could be that the robot will be confused. Therefore, in my opinion, CS work will still persist until the AI \u200b\u200bdeveloped is truly optimal.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, it is very possible, even now there is an implementation of customer service whose behavior has been replaced by machine systems. And this is a product of Artificial intelligence. In my opinion, the reason for replacing these jobs is to make the work of people easier, in this case those who work as customer service. Because there are a lot of users, it could even be said that almost all humans use it, it will make the service a bit confusing if it only relies on human power. I take the example of a cellular card operator, almost everyone who has a cellphone must have a cellular card or starter card, which we have. an ID that contains a number or is usually called a cellphone number. When the service from the starter card experiences problems, the user will automatically submit a complaint and if all of Indonesia complains, of course for customer service it is a disaster, therefore an artificial intelligence is created that makes the job of customer service easier in answering questions from users that are only of a nature the same, why is it only the same in nature? Because each user's desires and complaints will be different, that's why human customer service is still needed, because as intelligent as artificial intelligence is, it will never beat the intelligence that makes it, namely natural intelligence, human intelligence.",

        "answer": "Yes, because customer service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature can be analyzed, studied and then made robot machines that are able to imitate their jobs by utilizing AI Artificial Intelligence. Customer Service CS usually works to handle problems and complaints asked by customers. AI can be set to be able to answer various problems frequently asked by consumers and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. If we take a quick look at this, it will make things easier for customers. This AI can work 24 hours without stopping. Customers will be satisfied and don't need to wait until CS work time if they want to complain or question a problem. That way, one day CS jobs will slowly be replaced by robots. And for jobs that are repetitive in nature, they can be replaced by machines that utilize AI, AI is set to be able to imitate movements and how it works. This machine will be more profitable for the company because it does not need to recruit workers and can save costs, be more efficient and effective. That way, of course one day these jobs will be replaced by machines.",

        "answer": "The role of customer service is to solve problems when there are complaints or questions from consumers. Usually CS will be connected and can speak directly with consumers, after contacting the options provided. As time progresses, it is rumored that AI will begin to replace the original role of CS. This AI is set to be able to answer various problems that consumers frequently ask and respond based on the frequency with which these problems are encountered. At first glance, this will make things easier for customers because this AI can work 24 hours without stopping. Customers will be happy and don't have to wait for CS's turn to answer if they want to complain or question a problem. However, if you look at the role of CS, which is the recipient and solver of problems, of course interaction is needed. Sometimes interactions between humans and each other cannot be replaced by robots. AI only responds to questions that have been set in it. However, if there are other questions outside the settings, then that will be a weakness of the AI. Therefore, in my opinion, CS work will still persist until the AI \u200b\u200bdeveloped is truly optimal. Because humans need interaction between each other which AI does not provide.",

        "answer": "CS Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature could one day be replaced by machines. For example, currently the role of AI in the CS area is quite large and the aim is to increase customer satisfaction such as social listening and ticketing. Companies can utilize Natural Language Processing NLP, a type of artificial intelligence, and machine vision to identify customers so that companies can contact and respond to customers automatically or direct them to the right agent. However, this work, if it is still related to humans, still cannot be replaced by machines as a whole because of the need for feelings, something that machines do not or currently do not have, in human communication.",

        "answer": "Very possible, in the era of digital industry or industry 4.0 it is like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, industry 4.0 brings various positive advances, especially in terms of technology. But on the other hand, industry 4.0 makes humans not only compete with other humans, but also with robots. Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara said that jobs that are repetitive have a high probability of being replaced by robots. Jobs that are repetitive, for example, customer service, telephone information services such as in banking, many already use chatbots and factory workers, for example in automotive factories installing screws, and so on.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, customer service jobs can be replaced by machines, but not completely. The large number of complaints and needs from product users will be more effective if assisted by certain machines or programs, for example the program can group categories of complaints from product users and direct users to the page for claiming returns of goods due to defects or on another page according to the complaint submitted. A company can also design a program with an algorithm that can filter which user complaints can be handled and which are spam, or a program that can simultaneously store user complaint data as research about product quality. However, to be able to serve product users in certain activities, for example to return goods or improve the quality of goods, it still has to be done by humans. Machines or programs are only tools that support or help customer service to run efficiently. Meanwhile, in my opinion, customer service sometimes also requires interaction with fellow humans, for example in order to build trust with product users, telephone service still has to run. I analogize this to an application that offers chat with AI. Some may argue that psychologists are no longer needed if applications like this develop, but actually interactions with AI and interactions with humans are very different. There are certain things that cannot be discovered when someone interacts with AI compared to interacting with humans. Then I also think that jobs that are repetitive in nature can also be replaced by machines. Machines can do repetitive things more accurately because they are programmed than humans.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, Customer Service jobs can be replaced by machines, provided that the orders or services provided are repeated over and over again. The AI \u200b\u200bsystem can be programmed to process these commands automatically with the same output. This has advantages in terms of energy, time and cost efficiency compared to human customer service which has limited energy and gets tired when answering the same questions repeatedly. However, AI also has limitations when faced with complex and varied questions, for example there can be more than one answer to a question asked and requires further explanation. In this case, the role of customer service is still needed even though most of its roles can be replaced by AI. Workers in the customer service sector can answer consumer questions that require complex explanations and are outside the automatic answer program programmed into the AI \u200b\u200bsystem.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, in the near future some CS jobs will be replaced by machines. Even now, many customer services provide a list of frequently asked questions, because the problems complained of tend to be uniform. An AI system that can be trained with reinforcement learning might be able to replace humans entirely, but it would likely require a large training set that would be too expensive to realize right now.",

        "answer": "In my opinion, Customer Service jobs and jobs that are repetitive in nature can one day be replaced by machines but cannot be 100 the same as humans. As the digital era develops, the role of humans will slowly be replaced by machines that continue to develop, for example customer service which is being replaced by the implementation of AI-based chatbots. Machines can respond more quickly and are available at all times, whereas humans cannot be active 247, but AI cannot answer spontaneously like humans, AI must be programmed first, so that if there is a question outside of what has been programmed, AI cannot answer it, at the next opportunity AI can only answer it after he knows the question.

        "answer": "No. In my opinion, jobs like customer service require human communication skills that machines don't yet have. Current machines can only carry out simple communication with pre-programmed sentences or replies, while customer service work requires effective two-way communication. There are still many human characteristics that cannot be implemented on machines, such as non-verbal communication, controlled emotions, assertive attitude, netiquette, appropriate tone of voice, and adequate responses so as not to offend the person you are talking to.

        "answer": "In my opinion, one day there is a possibility of repetitive service work using machines. We can encounter the use of machines for repetitive services every day, when shopping online and having questions, we can send orders or chat to customer service which is controlled by the system. The system will then give us questions that can direct us as customers to the desired service. This is also done by call center operators where the machine will direct customers to the appropriate admin. However, for customer service that will serve customers, in my opinion, they will still be human. This is because customer questions can consist of various things and the system cannot necessarily understand what different customers want because a system only understands what is input into it. Therefore, although it is possible that machines can replace repetitive services, they will only increase the efficiency of the service. The interaction itself, from customer to admin or waiter, will still be handled by humans.",

        "answer": "I think yes, it can be replaced by machines. Because work that is static, procedural, repetitive can be replaced with a new, more efficient process, such as computers and robots. These computers and robots have artificial intelligence technology which makes it possible to imitate human motor skills, where these jobs can be taught to computers and robots through machine learning where computers and robots will learn through experience to carry out a task and their performance can be measured. This is the reason why these jobs will one day be replaced by machines.",

Companies only need to teach robots to answer thousands of questions that are asked regularly and if they encounter difficulties, people will look for CS. This robot can also detect grammatical errors, pronunciation errors and everyday language if there are grammatical errors. However, the implementation is not that easy because robots also have limitations in understanding the meaning of a word. For example, there is a sentence that has a double meaning. Deeper knowledge is needed to facilitate conversation and understand each other. Only those who have human feelings and instincts can understand the digestion of these words and their meaning. Looking at the current condition of Indonesia, this opinion is still considered less realistic because it takes a long time and a lot of money to realize AI quickly like that. Apart from that, people in Indonesia or Asia also still pay more attention to aspects of communication and language delivery and manners or attitude.

Currently, we are even experiencing the development of AI which is causing jobs such as customer service to be replaced by machines. An example is BCA Bank's virtual robot called Vira. The development of customer service work using these machines can be implemented through one of the AI \u200b\u200btechnologies, namely machine learning. ML machine learning technology is a machine that was developed to be able to learn on its own without any direction from the user. This learning was developed based on other scientific disciplines and data mining so that machines can learn and analyze data without the need for reprogramming or commands. The tasks that machine learning can perform depend on what it learns. With the application of this technology, it is possible to replace repetitive work because the machine can continue to learn what it is doing and correct the mistakes it makes by itself without requiring a command.",
