Smart Air Quality Monitoring Systems: IoT sensors are used to measure pollutants and chemicals in the air, providing real-time data for environmental monitoring and intelligent ventilation systems. This information can help identify pollution sources and enable timely interventions to improve air quality. 2. Smart Water Management Systems: IoT sensors are used to monitor water levels, temperature, and quality in bodies of water. Actuators like electric pumps and valves are then used to regulate water flow, ensuring efficient irrigation or preventing floods. For instance, in agriculture, smart irrigation systems use soil moisture sensors to optimize water usage and reduce wastage. 3. Wildlife Monitoring: IoT sensors can be used to track animal movements and behaviors, providing valuable data for conservation efforts. For example, GPS-enabled collars can help monitor the migration patterns of endangered species or study their habitat preferences. In agriculture, IoT is used to optimize farming practices and improve crop yields. Here are some examples: 1. Precision Farming: IoT sensors are used to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels. Actuators like electric pumps and valves are then used to apply water, fertilizers, or pesticides only where they're needed, reducing wastage and improving crop health. 2. Livestock Monitoring: IoT sensors can be used to monitor the health and behavior of livestock, providing real-time data for farmers to optimize feeding, breeding, and veterinary care. For example, temperature sensors in barns can help detect early signs of illness or distress in animals. 3. Smart Greenhouses: IoT sensors are used to monitor environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and light levels in greenhouses.

        "answer": "Environment In the environment IoT can be applied to monitor environmental conditions such as air quality, water quality, soil quality, temperature, and so on. The data will later be sent to the cell phones of environmental experts so that environmental conditions such as forests, for example, can continue to be monitored. Another example for forests might be fire or temperature detectors. There may be automatic water sprinklers if fire is detected to prevent forest fires. Farming Livestock animals certainly require certain environmental conditions to be able to reproduce optimally. One automation that can be done using the IoT concept is temperature adjustment. The sensor will send a certain signal if the temperature reaches a certain level, the signal will then be captured by the machine and may also be notified to the farmer so that certain actions can be taken to reduce or increase the temperature. Apart from that, livestock feeding may be automated in the future. With time indicators or certain stimuli from livestock, there will be a mechanism for providing food to livestock.",

        "answer": "Examples of implementing IoT in the environmental sector include the use of sensors which are now easier to use and carry anywhere. By using sensors in a cellphone and connecting it to a cellphone application to measure air quality, you can find out whether the air quality in a place is at a good level or not. This can be useful for monitoring air quality in areas, especially areas with high population levels such as city centers and also for users who have lung diseases that can recur if they are in areas with poor air quality. Meanwhile, an example of implementing IoT in agriculture is using sensors to monitor conditions on the farm. By using sensors, agricultural monitoring can be carried out online, thereby reducing the burden of routine direct supervision and saving costs.",

        "answer": "In the environmental sector, especially the living environment, IoT is used in monitoring air or water quality and can even monitor various animals that live in the wild. This IoT is used to warn you or alarm if pollution levels rise, for example water pollution so that people are more alert and can reduce fatalities. As an example, a river water quality monitoring system can be created. This system is designed to use a pH sensor, turbidity sensor and temperature sensor. Data from these three parameters is then sent wirelessly from the sensor node to the main node using radio frequency communication. Then the sensor data from the main node is sent to the database via the internet network and displayed on the website and Android application. The results of the test show that the system can work well where all sensor data can be displayed on the website and Android application. In the livestock sector, IoT is used to measure room temperature and humidity sensors with thermohygrometers, for example on chicken farms. In this way, the room temperature can be adjusted automatically and adjust to the needs of the farm. If the room temperature is too hot, the cooler will automatically turn on to reduce the heat in the room. Likewise with the feed arrangements. For example, the DHT11 sensor can be used to detect temperature and humidity in a chicken coop.",

        "answer": "1. Agriculture Application of the Internet of Things IoT technology concept in agricultural technology, namely the implementation of a telemonitoring system. Telemonitoring means the process of getting data in a place using sensors, and the data is sent via a wireless network which can be Bluetooth or other networks. In the era of precision agriculture, accuracy in setting planting times requires precise and fast data. This data will be processed and produce information for making decisions. So, the use of IoT-based telemonitoring has become a necessity. 2. Environment The benefit of implementing IoT is of course that it can monitor and protect an environment. The implementation is by monitoring water or air quality levels, atmospheric or soil conditions, and special monitoring of wild animals and their habitats. IoT can also be useful in disaster management in the form of tsunami or earthquake warning systems. In this case, IoT devices have wide geographic coverage and mobile capabilities. 3. Fisheries The application of NB-IoT technology in automatic fish feeder machines will simplify the process of feeding fish in even large ponds. This technology can regulate automatic feeding, making it easier for farmers to monitor and schedule feeding using a smartphone application. 4.

        "answer": "An example of IoT in the environmental sector is electric smart cars. Smartcars can learn the shortest routes to reach locations quickly and avoid traffic jams. This will reduce energy requirements so that you can save fuel. In order to find the shortest route, the car is connected to GPS. The additional use of sensors to reduce engine performance when the car is stopped can also reduce energy use. Using electricity as fuel also reduces carbon burning pollution in areas of human activity so that urban air conditions are cleaner. In the future, additional solar panels on car roofs can increase the effectiveness of energy management. During the day, the car can store power from sunlight energy. An example of IoT in the agricultural sector is a greenhouse with automatic environmental control. Plants can be grown using the hydroponic method using media according to the plant's needs. The pot is equipped with sensors for water adequacy and nutrient concentration. When the water or nutrients are below the minimum limit, the system will work so that the supply of water and nutrients is distributed from the storage area. The walls of the greenhouse are equipped with humidity, temperature and light sensors. When the humidity is low, the mist sprayer is turned on, while if the humidity is too high, a special blower is turned on to regulate the circulation of outgoing air. When the temperature is too high, the room is cooled with a cooler. When the light is too dim, the lights are turned on, whereas when light is not needed the lights are turned off and the roof can be covered with a light-proof roof layer. Each pot or row of plants can be equipped with a monitor that displays information on plant name, plant age, growth phase and plant condition to make it easier for farmers to control.",

        "answer": "In the IoT environment, it is useful for monitoring urban air quality, which is getting dirtier every day due to the large amount of air pollution. In its application, sensors can be used that can detect CO2 levels in the air, and then the data can be processed. and then appropriate treatment can be given, such as how much it needs to plant trees and so on. In agriculture, IoT is very useful for monitoring plant conditions and in some cases IoT can also help improve the quality and yield of agriculture. For example, IoT in hydroponics can be used to measure temperature, required nutrients, and meet the water needs of plants, because humans cannot monitor the plants 24 hours a day, and with IoT humans can also remotely monitor the plants using big data processing.",

Apart from that, IoT can also be used to monitor natural disasters, so that it can provide early warning to the public about potential disasters. Examples of IoT implementation in the fields of Agriculture or Fisheries or Livestock: Product Optimization Agricultural product optimization is influenced by certain situations such as weather forecasts, soil conditions, and market needs for certain crops. To make the right decisions, farmers need real-time data about current weather conditions. Wireless technology, GPS systems and the cloud can help farmers with this. Pest management Monitoring the number of pests using sensor networks could be a solution. If the sensor detects that the number of nuisance pests is too high, this information can be conveyed to the automatic pest control system for action to be taken. This can replace the use of pesticides in some cases. Effective use of resources The main resources in agriculture are water and soil nutrients. These components must be used efficiently. Lack of water and soil nutrients are the main enemies that can cause crop failure. So its use must be managed and controlled in detail and precisely. Using the power of IoT, farmers can measure and detect early deficiencies in these key components in agriculture. Then efficiently, you can manage the energy used. Everything in real-time. Optimization of production operations Agricultural production operations include fertilization, pest spraying and harvesting. All of these activities use special machines or equipment. By using IoT, farmers can know in real-time the position of their equipment. With this data, they carry out analysis and determine exactly where the production operation areas are to be carried out efficiently. This will have an impact on their agricultural yields. The application of the Internet of Things in agriculture can be used based on the need for food throughout the world which increases every year. The Internet of Things is not applied to the agricultural supply chain but also sensor technology for water use, sensors to detect pest attacks, and also sensors that maintain environmental temperature conditions. With this implementation, agricultural yields can increase rapidly. IoT technology uses applications that process information and infrastructure. Internet of Things IoT applications are similar to the realization of agricultural production knowledge, management, decision making, related to agricultural production. Internet of Things IoT applications include plant growth data processing facilities, digital management of production, data sharing, user interfaces and intelligent network services as well as decision-making. The concept of the Internet of Things is related to networks, which connect everything to the internet via Radio frequency Identification RFID, sensors, global positioning systems GPS, laser scanners and other information sensors according to approved protocols and exchange information that obtains knowledge identification, location tracking, monitoring and management. The network can automatically identify objects and locations, track, monitor and trigger event correspondents.
