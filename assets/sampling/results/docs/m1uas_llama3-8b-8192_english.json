Three examples of AI applications are: 1. Voice Recognition: Systems like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant that interpret and respond to voice commands. 2. Computer Vision: Technology allowing computers to \"see\" and interpret visual content, such as facial recognition or autonomous vehicle systems. 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Machines understanding and interacting with human language, used in chatbots, translators, and semantic search.",
