Here are examples of Big Data implementations, namely: Development of a forecasting system for the number of cases of a particular disease per week per region based on previously collected disease data. Of course, to create a system that has a high level of prediction accuracy, a large amount of Big Data is needed, so that the system or program that is compiled can make predictions based on the many cases of data that have occurred. In this implementation, in addition to using Big Data, knowledge in the fields of statistics and mathematics is also needed, especially regarding regression or statistical forecasting. Optimization of logistics delivery routes by a company. To create an optimization program, a large amount of Big Data is needed to ensure the accuracy of the algorithm.

The characteristics of big data are that it has 6V Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Validity, Volatility and Volume. variety Big Data refers to structured, unstructured, and semistructured data collected from various sources. In the past, data could only be collected from velocity. Velocity basically refers to the speed at which data is generated in real time. veracity data that runs quickly can become data that is biased, abnormal, and too noisy to use immediately. This means that there needs to be a strategy to reduce and process the big data obtained so that it can function. The validity of big data users of course needs to test the validity of the data obtained. Without a doubt, valid data is an important key to making the right decisions. volatility we need to consider the answer to the question of how long the data is valid and how long volatility needs to be displayed. This is related to the velocity aspect where it is very possible to get real time data. Special considerations need to be taken to assess the relevance of the data to the needs of city managers.

        "answer": "In simple terms, a data set to be called Big Data has the following characteristics, namely: The data in the data set is very large and continues to grow exponentially over time. The very large amount of data causes the data set to be unable to be processed and analyzed using conventional data processing methods. If data mining, data storage, data analysis, data sharing, and data visualization are carried out on a very large data set, it is necessary to apply the concepts of Big Data because the amount is very large. If explained further, some of the characteristics of the data set called Big Data are: Volume means that data can be categorized as Big Data if it has a large size or is possible to grow very quickly so that it requires very large storage. Variety means that data can be called Big Data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database. Velocity means that Big Data has the characteristic of changing very quickly both in terms of variables and data types. With these characteristics, a special touch is needed in processing Big Data. Veracity means that Big Data has vulnerabilities in terms of accuracy and validity, so it requires depth to analyze Big Data in order to produce the right decision. Value means that Big Data has a very high value if processed in the right way. Thus, it is clear that Big Data is not only about very large size but also has characteristics such as very diverse data types and very high growth rates and frequency of change.",

        "ground_truth": "The characteristics of a data collection called Big Data are often summarized by the \"5Vs\": 1. Volume: Refers to the enormous amount of data generated every day. 2. Velocity: Indicates the rate at which new data is generated and how quickly it needs to be processed. 3. Variety: Describes the different types and sources of data available, including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. 4. Veracity: Relates to the quality and accuracy of data. 5. Value: Refers to the value or information that can be obtained from Big Data processing. These characteristics highlight the scale, complexity, and diversity of Big Data, which require specialized processing and analysis techniques to extract valuable insights.",
        "answer": "VARIETY means that data can be called big data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database. VELOCITY is very high data growth and tends to be real time. VOLUME means that data shows a very large volume of data. Big data is a collection of processes consisting of large volumes of data that are structured or unstructured and used to help business activities. VALUE means that big data has a very high value if it is processed in an appropriate way or it can also be said how valuable or meaningful a data is. VERACITY refers to data trust. The more data is collected and analyzed automatically but is not captured in its entirety due to high volume and speed. the larger the data, the higher the uncertainty about the accuracy of the data.",
