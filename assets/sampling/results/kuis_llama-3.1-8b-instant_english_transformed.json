        "answer": "In general, mathematics can be said to be the basis of Big Data. This is because in carrying out data analysis, a lot of knowledge in the field of mathematics, especially statistics, is used. Thus, basically it can be said that the implementation of Big Data in every field is the implementation of Big Data in the field of mathematics. Examples of Big Data implementation are: Development of a forecasting system for the number of cases of certain diseases per week per region based on disease data that has been previously collected. Of course, to create a system that has a high level of predictive accuracy, large amounts of Big Data are needed, so that the system or program that is prepared can make predictions based on many data cases that have occurred. In this implementation, apart from using Big Data, knowledge is also required in the fields of statistics and mathematics, especially regarding regression or statistical forecasting.  Optimization of logistics delivery routes by a company. To create an optimization program, large amounts of Big Data are needed to ensure the accuracy of the algorithm.

This means that there needs to be a strategy to reduce and process the big data obtained so that it can function. validity big data users of course need to test the validity of the data obtained. Without a doubt, valid data is an important key to making the right decisions. volatility we need to weigh the answers to the questions of how long the data is valid and how long volatility needs to be displayed.

        "answer": "In simple terms, a data set to be called Big Data has the following characteristics, namely: The data in the data set is very large and continues to grow exponentially over time. The very large amount of data causes the data set to be unable to be processed and analyzed using conventional data processing methods. If data mining, data storage, data analysis, data sharing, and data visualization are carried out on a very large data set, it is necessary to apply the concepts of Big Data because the amount is very large. If explained further, some of the characteristics of the data set called Big Data are: Volume means that data can be categorized as Big Data if it has a large size or is possible to grow very quickly so that it requires very large storage. Variety means that data can be called Big Data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database. Velocity means that Big Data has the characteristic of changing very quickly both in terms of variables and data types. With these characteristics, a special touch is needed in processing Big Data. Veracity means that Big Data has vulnerabilities in terms of accuracy and validity, so it requires depth to analyze Big Data in order to produce the right decision. Value means that Big Data has a very high value if processed in the right way.

        "answer": "VARIETY means that data can be called big data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database. VELOCITY is very high data growth and tends to be real time. VOLUME means that data shows a very large volume of data. Big data is a collection of processes consisting of large volumes of data that are structured or unstructured and used to help business activities. VALUE means that big data has a very high value if it is processed in an appropriate way or it can also be said how valuable or meaningful a data is. VERACITY refers to data trust. The more data is collected and analyzed automatically but is not captured in its entirety due to high volume and speed. the larger the data, the higher the uncertainty about the accuracy of the data.",

Big Data is a complex concept, so it requires more knowledge in applying the concept of Big Data. This level of difficulty is what causes the lack of data processing experts who can process Big Data. The need for emphasis on data security. In this modern era, data, especially sensitive data, needs to be secured to avoid cyber hacker attacks. Big Data which is data in large quantities raises challenges in terms of security, namely how to secure data in large quantities. Integration of data from various sources.
