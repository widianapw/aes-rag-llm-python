By analyzing data related to customer demand, inventory, and production processes, they can identify areas where efficiency can be improved, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction by ensuring the right product is available at the right time.",
        "answer": "The SIMRS hospital information system will summarize all patient data and patient examination data. With the recapitulation of patient data, it is expected to help medical personnel in reducing drug prescription errors and can summarize patient transaction data in depth. For this reason, it is necessary to implement Big Data which aims to analyze patient recapitulation data to help medical personnel in reducing drug prescription errors.",
