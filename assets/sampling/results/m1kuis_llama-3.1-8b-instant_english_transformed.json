        "answer": "In general, mathematics can be said to be the basis of Big Data. This is because in conducting data analysis, of course, a lot of knowledge in the field of mathematics is used, especially statistics. Thus, it can basically be said that the implementation of Big Data in every field is the implementation of Big Data in the field of mathematics. Here are examples of Big Data implementations, namely: Development of a forecasting system for the number of cases of a particular disease per week per region based on previously collected disease data. Of course, to create a system that has a high level of prediction accuracy, a large amount of Big Data is needed, so that the system or program that is compiled can make predictions based on the many cases of data that have occurred. In this implementation, in addition to using Big Data, knowledge in the fields of statistics and mathematics is also needed, especially regarding regression or statistical forecasting. Optimization of logistics delivery routes by a company. To create an optimization program, a large amount of Big Data is needed to ensure the accuracy of the algorithm. In this implementation, in addition to using Big Data, knowledge in the fields of mathematics and computer science is also needed, especially regarding graph theory and operations research.",

It's what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better strategic business decisions and movements. The characteristics of big data are having 6V Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Validity, Volatility and Volume. variety Big Data Variation refers to structured, unstructured and semi-structured data collected from various sources. In the past, data could only be collected from velocity Velocity basically refers to the speed at which data is created in real time. veracity fast-moving data can be biased, abnormal and too noisy to be used immediately. This means that there needs to be a strategy to reduce and process the big data obtained so that it can function. validity big data users of course need to test the validity of the data obtained. Without a doubt, valid data is an important key to making the right decisions. volatility we need to weigh the answers to the questions of how long the data is valid and how long volatility needs to be displayed. This is related to the velocity aspect where it is very possible to get real-time data. Special considerations need to be given to assessing the relevance of data to the needs of city managers.

        "answer": "In simple terms, a data set to be called Big Data has the following characteristics, namely: The data contained in the data set is very large and continues to grow exponentially over time.  The large amount of data means that the data collection cannot be processed and analyzed using conventional data processing methods.  If data mining, data storage, data analysis, data sharing, and data visualization are used to collect large amounts of data, it is necessary to apply Big Data concepts because the amount is very large. If explained further, several characteristics of a data collection called Big Data are: Volume means that data can be categorized into Big Data if it has a large size or it is possible that it can grow very quickly so that it requires very large storage.  Variety means that data can be called Big Data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse, including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database.  Velocity means Big Data has the characteristic of changing very quickly both in terms of variables and data types. With these characteristics, a special touch is needed in processing Big Data.  Veracity means Big Data has vulnerabilities in terms of accuracy and validity so it requires depth to analyze Big Data in order to produce the right decisions.  Value means that Big Data has very high value if it is processed in an appropriate way. Thus, it is clear that Big Data is not only about very large sizes but also has characteristics such as very diverse types of data and very high rates of growth and frequency of change.",

Issues regarding data growth. Big Data which continues to increase in terms of data will give rise to various problems, especially those related to data storage. Lack of data processing experts. Big Data is a complex concept, so it requires more knowledge in applying the concept of Big Data. This level of difficulty is what causes the lack of data processing experts who can process Big Data. The need for emphasis on data security. In this modern era, data, especially sensitive data, needs to be secured to avoid cyber hacker attacks. Big Data which is data in large quantities raises challenges in terms of security, namely how to secure data in large quantities. Integration of data from various sources. Big Data which is data collected from various sources requires initial processing to adjust the incoming varied data, thus raising challenges due to the very varied sources of Big Data.",
