        "answer": "In general, mathematics can be said to be the basis of Big Data. This is because in conducting data analysis, of course, a lot of knowledge in the field of mathematics is used, especially statistics. Thus, it can basically be said that the implementation of Big Data in every field is the implementation of Big Data in the field of mathematics. Here are examples of Big Data implementations, namely: Development of a forecasting system for the number of cases of a particular disease per week per region based on previously collected disease data. Of course, to create a system that has a high level of prediction accuracy, a large amount of Big Data is needed, so that the system or program that is compiled can make predictions based on the many cases of data that have occurred. In this implementation, in addition to using Big Data, knowledge in the fields of statistics and mathematics is also needed, especially regarding regression or statistical forecasting. Optimization of logistics delivery routes by a company. To create an optimization program, a large amount of Big Data is needed to ensure the accuracy of the algorithm.

The characteristics of big data are having 6V Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Validity, Volatility and Volume. variety Big Data Variation refers to structured, unstructured and semi-structured data collected from various sources. In the past, data could only be collected from velocity Velocity basically refers to the speed at which data is created in real time. veracity fast-moving data can be biased, abnormal and too noisy to be used immediately. This means that there needs to be a strategy to reduce and process the big data obtained so that it can function. validity big data users of course need to test the validity of the data obtained. Without a doubt, valid data is an important key to making the right decisions. volatility we need to weigh the answers to the questions of how long the data is valid and how long volatility needs to be displayed. This is related to the velocity aspect where it is very possible to get real-time data. Special considerations need to be given to assessing the relevance of data to the needs of city managers.

        "answer": "In simple terms, a data set to be called Big Data has the following characteristics, namely: The data in the data set is very large and continues to grow exponentially over time. The very large amount of data causes the data set to be unable to be processed and analyzed using conventional data processing methods. If data mining, data storage, data analysis, data sharing, and data visualization are carried out on a very large data set, it is necessary to apply the concepts of Big Data because the amount is very large. If explained further, some of the characteristics of the data set called Big Data are: Volume means that data can be categorized as Big Data if it has a large size or is possible to grow very quickly so that it requires very large storage. Variety means that data can be called Big Data if it has various characteristics and is not homogeneous, but has many variables and is very diverse including various types of data, both data that has been structured in a database and data that is not organized in a database. Velocity means that Big Data has the characteristic of changing very quickly both in terms of variables and data types. With these characteristics, a special touch is needed in processing Big Data. Veracity means that Big Data has vulnerabilities in terms of accuracy and validity, so it requires depth to analyze Big Data in order to produce the right decision. Value means that Big Data has a very high value if processed in the right way. Thus, it is clear that Big Data is not only about very large size but also has characteristics such as very diverse data types and very high growth rates and frequency of change.",

Intended Use: Relational databases are designed for daily transactional and operational data (OLTP), while data warehouses are designed for data analysis and business reporting (OLAP). 2. Data Structure: Relational databases use a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns, whereas data warehouses use a format optimized for querying and analysis, often using a star schema or snow schema. 3. Optimization: Relational databases are optimized for speed and efficiency in processing small to medium data transactions in real-time, whereas data warehouses are optimized for big data processing and analysis, supporting complex and data-intensive read operations.",
        "answer": "A RELATIONAL DATABASE is a collection of data items with predefined relationships. These items are organized into a set of tables with columns and rows. A WAREHOUSE DATABASE is a database designed for querying and analysis, rather than for transaction processing.

        "answer": "Some challenges in implementing Big Data, namely: Lack of understanding of the concept of Big Data, so that problems often arise when applying data processing techniques. Issues regarding data growth. Big Data which continues to increase in terms of data will give rise to various problems, especially those related to data storage. Lack of data processing experts. Big Data is a complex concept, so it requires more knowledge in applying the concept of Big Data. This level of difficulty is what causes the lack of data processing experts who can process Big Data. The need for emphasis on data security. In this modern era, data, especially sensitive data, needs to be secured to avoid cyber hacker attacks. Big Data which is data in large quantities raises challenges in terms of security, namely how to secure data in large quantities. Integration of data from various sources. Big Data which is data collected from various sources requires initial processing to adjust the incoming varied data, thus raising challenges due to the very varied sources of Big Data.",
