Meanwhile, according to Mc Leod and Schell, artificial intelligence is the activity of providing machines such as computers with the ability to display behavior that is considered as intelligent as if the ability was displayed by humans. In other words, AI is a computer system that can do jobs that generally require human power or human intelligence to complete the job.
