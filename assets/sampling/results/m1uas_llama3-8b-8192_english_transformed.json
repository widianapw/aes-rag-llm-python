        "answer": "Repetitive work, in my opinion, can be replaced by machines. This is because various technologies have now developed, especially in the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 towards 5.0 which is increasingly digitizing society. Various technologies such as the Internet of Things IoT and Artificial Intelligence AI already exist and have various capabilities that can compete with human capabilities that are repetitive in nature. This is because these systems have been designed to have human capabilities such as learning, making decisions, and correcting mistakes, and even tend to be more accurate than humans with the presence of Big Data. In addition, computers and machines are also considered more capable of managing data in larger quantities and faster than human capabilities.

Moreover, the value of Big Data, as discussed in the context, lies in its ability to transform data into actionable insights and create value for organizations or individuals. In the case of customer service, AI and machine learning can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, enabling personalized interactions and improved customer experiences. However, human intervention will still be necessary for handling complex issues that require empathy, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills. Additionally, the context emphasizes the importance of well-being and work-life balance, as well as advocacy and social support for workers impacted by automation. This suggests that there will continue to be a need for human roles in customer service and other industries undergoing digital transformation. In summary, while technology will undoubtedly replace some customer service jobs and repetitive tasks, the human role will remain essential in providing a personal touch and handling complex issues. The ongoing digital transformation will require a proactive and adaptive approach, with a focus on lifelong learning, upskilling, and readiness to adapt to change.",
        "answer": "The use of AI in managing customer service is rampant. However, it does not mean that AI customer service will completely replace human interaction in the field of customer service. Customer service is very important in a company because they are the representatives of the company to build a reputation and increase engagement rates by serving customers well. AI can indeed quickly overcome situations with a high level of urgency quickly, but when it comes to scenarios that require high emotions, especially in the interaction with human customers, there is no AI that can imitate human empathy. In conclusion, the development of AI will continue to grow and AI can gradually replace human interaction in the field of customer service, but there will always be humans who hold control behind it.",

This phenomenon is not new; throughout history, technological innovation has changed the employment landscape, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. For instance, the industrial revolution reduced labor requirements in manual farming but created many jobs in factories. In today's digital era, automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to replace many routine and manual jobs, such as manufacturing, data entry, and even some aspects of customer service. Simultaneously, technology will create new jobs, especially in fields that require critical thinking, creativity, technology management, and interpersonal skills. Examples of new jobs include AI developers, big data analysts, cybersecurity specialists, and jobs related to renewable energy. To deal with this change, it is essential to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. Here are some attitudes and strategies: 1. Continuous Education and Lifelong Learning: People must adapt by learning new skills and increasing their knowledge continuously. Education no longer stops after school or university but becomes a lifelong process. 2. Flexibility and Adaptability: It is important to remain flexible and open to career changes. This may mean being willing to change career paths or industries to take advantage of new opportunities that arise. 3. Improved Soft Skills: In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. Machines may be able to automate tasks, but human creativity and the ability to interact effectively with others will remain valuable. 4. Entrepreneurship: Increase the ability to innovate and create new business opportunities. A rapidly changing world requires new solutions, and entrepreneurship is key to overcoming these challenges. In summary, technological advancements will lead to a shift in the job market, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. To adapt, individuals must be open to continuous learning, flexible, adaptable, and focused on improving their soft skills. Entrepreneurship can also help create new opportunities.",

        "answer": "- With the development of technology, jobs that do not require human factors, for example: bank tellers, accountants, factory workers, even programmers will be replaced by machines and AI. This certainly makes sense and is profitable, considering that AI requires less salary and rest time than human workers, and can make fewer mistakes. If we do not act quickly, the human workers who are replaced will be unemployed. - New business opportunities are starting to emerge, such as online shops, content creators, and others. If we follow this trend, the possibility of losing jobs can be overcome. Another thing that can be added to yourself is soft skills, which of course will be a consideration for management in recruiting employees.",

Where in the past a factory would require a lot of workers to work on it. But now, with the presence of robots, the work process in the factory does not require many people. Only a supervisor is needed to run the machine. In addition, the use of robots can also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of work in the factory and can improve quality because robots are programmed to produce products with the same quality. This is what reduces the work of factory workers. On the other hand, the tools in the factory require officers to keep the tools running, maintain them and so on so that new types of jobs related to the AI \u200b\u200btools will emerge.

        "answer": "Jobs that are repetitive and monotonous can be replaced by machines, for example, jobs related to machines such as factory workers, over time their jobs can be replaced by machines. The use of machines is something that is beneficial because machines do not need to be treated like humans, do not need work insurance, do not need to be paid and given benefits, and other reasons. The impact is that there is a possibility that new types of jobs will emerge as compensation for the replacement of human labor with machine labor in order to continue to open up job opportunities for the community. In my opinion, it is likely that the jobs that emerge will also be related to the use of these machines, for example people who operate them, create systems or machines, there may even be a special sector in the government that is tasked with regulating regulations regarding machine power. Attitude and strategy: Be prepared to be able to adapt to all possibilities that will occur Do not close yourself off to change, because every change that occurs will definitely have a positive impact that we can feel. We must be willing to adapt and develop ourselves so that we can fit in the new environment. Improve and deepen the field of science that we are currently studying, with the knowledge we have we can also contribute to developing these machines and continue to update the latest facts and science that are in accordance with the development of the times so that the machines can also adapt.
