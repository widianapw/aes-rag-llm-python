        "ground_truth": "Based on the context provided, it is expected that technology, particularly AI and automation, will take over many aspects of customer service and repetitive tasks. However, human roles will remain important in providing a personal touch and handling more complex or sensitive cases. This aligns with the concept of Technology Readiness, where new technologies are applied in various fields, including customer service and workforce transformation. Moreover, the value of Big Data, as discussed in the context, lies in its ability to transform data into actionable insights and create value for organizations or individuals. In the case of customer service, AI and machine learning can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, enabling personalized interactions and improved customer experiences. However, human intervention will still be necessary for handling complex issues that require empathy, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills. Additionally, the context emphasizes the importance of well-being and work-life balance, as well as advocacy and social support for workers impacted by automation. This suggests that there will continue to be a need for human roles in customer service and other industries undergoing digital transformation. In summary, while technology will undoubtedly replace some customer service jobs and repetitive tasks, the human role will remain essential in providing a personal touch and handling complex issues. The ongoing digital transformation will require a proactive and adaptive approach, with a focus on lifelong learning, upskilling, and readiness to adapt to change.",
        "answer": "The use of AI in managing customer service is widespread. However, this does not mean that AI customer service will completely replace human interaction in the field of customer service. Customer service is very important in a company because they are the representatives of the company to build reputation and increase engagement rates by serving customers well. AI can indeed quickly resolve situations with a high level of urgency quickly, but when it comes to scenarios that require high levels of emotion, especially in the interaction with human customers, there is no AI that can imitate human empathy. In conclusion, the development of AI will continue to grow and AI can gradually replace human interaction in the field of customer service, but there will always be humans who are in control behind it.",

        "answer": "Sensors are one of the most important parts of IoT where sensors will collect certain data according to previously formed algorithms. For example: On a farm there is a temperature sensor where if a certain temperature is reached or with certain conditions there will be a temperature adjustment mechanism. So in this case the sensor functions to collect data about temperature. Another example is to monitor a patient's blood pressure. The sensor will send data about the patient's blood pressure and if certain conditions are met then certain actions may be required by the relevant medical personnel. In agriculture, for example, the sensor may detect the temperature of the plantation or the acidity or humidity of the soil. If certain conditions are met there may be a mechanism for automatic watering.",

        "ground_truth": "The prediction that existing jobs will decrease while new types of jobs will emerge is a result of technological evolution, automation, and digitalization. This phenomenon is not new; throughout history, technological innovation has changed the employment landscape, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. For instance, the industrial revolution reduced labor requirements in manual farming but created many jobs in factories. In today's digital era, automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to replace many routine and manual jobs, such as manufacturing, data entry, and even some aspects of customer service. Simultaneously, technology will create new jobs, especially in fields that require critical thinking, creativity, technology management, and interpersonal skills. Examples of new jobs include AI developers, big data analysts, cybersecurity specialists, and jobs related to renewable energy. To deal with this change, it is essential to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. Here are some attitudes and strategies: 1. Continuous Education and Lifelong Learning: People must adapt by learning new skills and increasing their knowledge continuously. Education no longer stops after school or university but becomes a lifelong process. 2. Flexibility and Adaptability: It is important to remain flexible and open to career changes. This may mean being willing to change career paths or industries to take advantage of new opportunities that arise. 3. Improved Soft Skills: In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. Machines may be able to automate tasks, but human creativity and the ability to interact effectively with others will remain valuable. 4.

        "answer": "With the development of AI, all jobs can be replaced by robots. What is already clearly visible is the machines in industrial factories. Where in the past a factory would require a lot of workers to work on it. But now, with the presence of robots, the work process in the factory does not require many people. Only a supervisor is needed to run the machine. In addition, the use of robots can also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of work in the factory and can improve quality because robots are programmed to produce products with the same quality. This is what reduces the work of factory workers. On the other hand, the tools in the factory require officers to keep the tools running, maintain them and so on so that new types of jobs related to the AI \u200b\u200btools will emerge. We must be humans who develop, not stop at what is currently available but follow the flow of development. For example, by adding skills that we have regarding technological developments in our work so that when the time comes we have the provisions to follow it.",

        "answer": "Work that is repetitive and monotonous can be replaced by machines, for example jobs related to machines such as factory workers, over time their jobs can be replaced by machines. The use of machines is something that is profitable because machines do not need to be treated like humans, they do not need work insurance, they do not need to be paid salaries and benefits, and other reasons. As a result, it is likely that new types of jobs will emerge as compensation for the replacement of human labor with machine labor in order to continue to open up employment opportunities for the community. In my opinion, it is very likely that the jobs that emerge will also be related to the use of these machines, for example the people who operate them, create the systems or machines, there could even be a special sector in government which is tasked with regulating regulations regarding the power of these machines. Attitude and strategy: Be prepared to be able to adapt to all possibilities that will occur. Don't close yourself off to change, because every change that occurs will definitely have a positive impact that we can feel. We must be willing to adapt and develop ourselves so that we can fit in this new environment.
