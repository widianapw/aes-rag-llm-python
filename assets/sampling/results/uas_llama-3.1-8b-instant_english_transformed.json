        "answer": "Repetitive work, in my opinion, can be replaced by machines. This is because various technologies have now developed, especially in the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 towards 5.0 which is increasingly digitizing society. Various technologies such as the Internet of Things IoT and Artificial Intelligence AI already exist and have various capabilities that can compete with human capabilities that are repetitive in nature. This is because these systems have been designed to have human capabilities such as learning, making decisions, and correcting mistakes, and even tend to be more accurate than humans with the presence of Big Data. In addition, computers and machines are also considered more capable of managing data in larger quantities and faster than human capabilities. Therefore, as humans, we are also required to be more open and increasingly innovative so as not to lose out to machines that have been digitized.",

        "answer": "With the development of AI, all jobs can be replaced by robots. What is already clearly visible is the machines in industrial factories. Where in the past a factory would require a lot of workers to work on it. But now, with the presence of robots, the work process in the factory does not require many people. Only a supervisor is needed to run the machine. In addition, the use of robots can also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of work in the factory and can improve quality because robots are programmed to produce products with the same quality. This is what reduces the work of factory workers. On the other hand, the tools in the factory require officers to keep the tools running, maintain them and so on so that new types of jobs related to the AI \u200b\u200btools will emerge.

        "ground_truth": "The prediction that existing jobs will decrease while new types of jobs will emerge is a result of technological evolution, automation, and digitalization. This phenomenon is not new; throughout history, technological innovation has changed the employment landscape, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. For instance, the industrial revolution reduced labor requirements in manual farming but created many jobs in factories. In today's digital era, automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to replace many routine and manual jobs, such as manufacturing, data entry, and even some aspects of customer service. Simultaneously, technology will create new jobs, especially in fields that require critical thinking, creativity, technology management, and interpersonal skills. Examples of new jobs include AI developers, big data analysts, cybersecurity specialists, and jobs related to renewable energy. To deal with this change, it is essential to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. Here are some attitudes and strategies: 1. Continuous Education and Lifelong Learning: People must adapt by learning new skills and increasing their knowledge continuously. Education no longer stops after school or university but becomes a lifelong process. 2. Flexibility and Adaptability: It is important to remain flexible and open to career changes. This may mean being willing to change career paths or industries to take advantage of new opportunities that arise. 3. Improved Soft Skills: In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. Machines may be able to automate tasks, but human creativity and the ability to interact effectively with others will remain valuable. 4. Entrepreneurship: Increase the ability to innovate and create new business opportunities. A rapidly changing world requires new solutions, and entrepreneurship is key to overcoming these challenges.

        "answer": "Jobs that are repetitive and monotonous can be replaced by machines, for example, jobs related to machines such as factory workers, over time their jobs can be replaced by machines. The use of machines is something that is beneficial because machines do not need to be treated like humans, do not need work insurance, do not need to be paid and given benefits, and other reasons. The impact is that there is a possibility that new types of jobs will emerge as compensation for the replacement of human labor with machine labor in order to continue to open up job opportunities for the community. In my opinion, it is likely that the jobs that emerge will also be related to the use of these machines, for example people who operate them, create systems or machines, there may even be a special sector in the government that is tasked with regulating regulations regarding machine power. Attitude and strategy: Be prepared to be able to adapt to all possibilities that will occur Do not close yourself off to change, because every change that occurs will definitely have a positive impact that we can feel. We must be willing to adapt and develop ourselves so that we can fit in the new environment. Improve and deepen the field of science that we are currently studying, with the knowledge we have we can also contribute to developing these machines and continue to update the latest facts and science that are in accordance with the development of the times so that the machines can also adapt. Add other fields of science related to the planning, manufacture, and operation of these machines because basically a change that big will definitely require a lot of human resources.",
