Traditional data sources are less diverse and varied, tending to be in 1 source, different from big data which has diverse and varied data sources from various sources. Processing big data sources requires someone who is an expert because new big data sources are meaningful or have very high value if processed in the right way, unlike traditional data which is the opposite. Because big data sources are diverse, their accuracy and validity are vulnerable, so they require good analysis so that the right decisions are made.",

For example: On farms there are temperature sensors where if a certain temperature is reached or under certain conditions there will be a temperature adjustment mechanism. So in this case the sensor functions to collect data about temperature.  Another example is to monitor a patient's blood pressure. The sensor will send data about the patient's blood pressure and if certain conditions are met then certain actions may be required by the relevant medical personnel.  In agriculture, for example, sensors might detect plantation temperature or soil acidity or moisture. If certain conditions are met there may be a mechanism for automatic watering.",

        "answer": "With the development of AI, all jobs can be replaced by robots. What is already clearly visible is the machines in industrial factories. Where in the past a factory would require a lot of workers to work on it. But now, with the presence of robots, the work process in the factory does not require many people. Only a supervisor is needed to run the machine. In addition, the use of robots can also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of work in the factory and can improve quality because robots are programmed to produce products with the same quality. This is what reduces the work of factory workers. On the other hand, the tools in the factory require officers to keep the tools running, maintain them and so on so that new types of jobs related to the AI \u200b\u200btools will emerge. We must be humans who develop, not stop at what is currently available but follow the flow of development.

        "ground_truth": "The prediction that existing jobs will decrease while new types of jobs will emerge is a result of technological evolution, automation, and digitalization. This phenomenon is not new; throughout history, technological innovation has changed the employment landscape, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. For instance, the industrial revolution reduced labor requirements in manual farming but created many jobs in factories. In today's digital era, automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to replace many routine and manual jobs, such as manufacturing, data entry, and even some aspects of customer service. Simultaneously, technology will create new jobs, especially in fields that require critical thinking, creativity, technology management, and interpersonal skills. Examples of new jobs include AI developers, big data analysts, cybersecurity specialists, and jobs related to renewable energy. To deal with this change, it is essential to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. Here are some attitudes and strategies: 1. Continuous Education and Lifelong Learning: People must adapt by learning new skills and increasing their knowledge continuously. Education no longer stops after school or university but becomes a lifelong process. 2. Flexibility and Adaptability: It is important to remain flexible and open to career changes. This may mean being willing to change career paths or industries to take advantage of new opportunities that arise. 3. Improved Soft Skills: In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. Machines may be able to automate tasks, but human creativity and the ability to interact effectively with others will remain valuable. 4. Entrepreneurship: Increase the ability to innovate and create new business opportunities. A rapidly changing world requires new solutions, and entrepreneurship is key to overcoming these challenges. In summary, technological advancements will lead to a shift in the job market, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones.

        "answer": "Jobs that are repetitive and monotonous can be replaced by machines, for example, jobs related to machines such as factory workers, over time their jobs can be replaced by machines. The use of machines is something that is beneficial because machines do not need to be treated like humans, do not need work insurance, do not need to be paid and given benefits, and other reasons. The impact is that there is a possibility that new types of jobs will emerge as compensation for the replacement of human labor with machine labor in order to continue to open up job opportunities for the community. In my opinion, it is likely that the jobs that emerge will also be related to the use of these machines, for example people who operate them, create systems or machines, there may even be a special sector in the government that is tasked with regulating regulations regarding machine power. Attitude and strategy: Be prepared to be able to adapt to all possibilities that will occur Do not close yourself off to change, because every change that occurs will definitely have a positive impact that we can feel. We must be willing to adapt and develop ourselves so that we can fit in the new environment. Improve and deepen the field of science that we are currently studying, with the knowledge we have we can also contribute to developing these machines and continue to update the latest facts and science that are in accordance with the development of the times so that the machines can also adapt. Add other fields of science related to the planning, manufacture, and operation of these machines because basically a change that big will definitely require a lot of human resources.",

Simultaneously, technology will create new jobs, especially in fields that require critical thinking, creativity, technology management, and interpersonal skills. Examples of new jobs include AI developers, big data analysts, cybersecurity specialists, and jobs related to renewable energy. To deal with this change, it is essential to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. Here are some attitudes and strategies: 1. Continuous Education and Lifelong Learning: People must adapt by learning new skills and increasing their knowledge continuously. Education no longer stops after school or university but becomes a lifelong process. 2. Flexibility and Adaptability: It is important to remain flexible and open to career changes. This may mean being willing to change career paths or industries to take advantage of new opportunities that arise. 3. Improved Soft Skills: In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. Machines may be able to automate tasks, but human creativity and the ability to interact effectively with others will remain valuable. 4. Entrepreneurship: Increase the ability to innovate and create new business opportunities. A rapidly changing world requires new solutions, and entrepreneurship is key to overcoming these challenges. In summary, technological advancements will lead to a shift in the job market, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. To adapt, individuals must be open to continuous learning, flexible, adaptable, and focused on improving their soft skills. Entrepreneurship can also help create new opportunities.",

Another example for forests might be a fire or temperature detector. There might be automatic watering if a fire is detected to prevent forest fires. Livestock Animals certainly need certain environmental conditions to be able to reproduce optimally. One automation using the IoT concept that can be done is temperature adjustment. The sensor will send a certain signal if the temperature reaches a certain level, the signal will then be captured by the machine and may also be notified to the farmer so that certain actions can be taken to reduce or increase the temperature. In addition, feeding livestock may later be automated. With time indicators or certain stimuli from livestock, there will be a mechanism for feeding livestock.",

Velocity: The velocity characteristic in big data refers to the speed of data transfer, data compilation, and the speed of data typing created in real time. 3. Variety: The variety characteristic in big data shows that data of various types can be grouped into a structured database. 4. Varicity: The varicity characteristic in big data refers to the validity of the data. Because big data can help analyze various types of data in large volumes so that the amount of data does not make the information obtained less valid. 5.
