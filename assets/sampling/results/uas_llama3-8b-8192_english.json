        "answer": "The job can be replaced by machines someday due to the development of technology and artificial intelligence. Maybe someday a machine will be created that we can teach to be like customer service so that it can replace it, especially for other repetitive jobs. Machines need to be taught because technology needs data to be used as knowledge first before doing a job. Artificial Intelligence can also correct its own mistakes so that it can continue to learn from its own mistakes.",

        "ground_truth": "Based on the context provided, it is expected that technology, particularly AI and automation, will take over many aspects of customer service and repetitive tasks. However, human roles will remain important in providing a personal touch and handling more complex or sensitive cases. This aligns with the concept of Technology Readiness, where new technologies are applied in various fields, including customer service and workforce transformation. Moreover, the value of Big Data, as discussed in the context, lies in its ability to transform data into actionable insights and create value for organizations or individuals. In the case of customer service, AI and machine learning can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, enabling personalized interactions and improved customer experiences. However, human intervention will still be necessary for handling complex issues that require empathy, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills. Additionally, the context emphasizes the importance of well-being and work-life balance, as well as advocacy and social support for workers impacted by automation. This suggests that there will continue to be a need for human roles in customer service and other industries undergoing digital transformation.

To deal with this change, it is essential to adopt a proactive and adaptive approach. Here are some attitudes and strategies: 1. Continuous Education and Lifelong Learning: People must adapt by learning new skills and increasing their knowledge continuously. Education no longer stops after school or university but becomes a lifelong process. 2. Flexibility and Adaptability: It is important to remain flexible and open to career changes. This may mean being willing to change career paths or industries to take advantage of new opportunities that arise. 3. Improved Soft Skills: In addition to technical skills, soft skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. Machines may be able to automate tasks, but human creativity and the ability to interact effectively with others will remain valuable. 4. Entrepreneurship: Increase the ability to innovate and create new business opportunities. A rapidly changing world requires new solutions, and entrepreneurship is key to overcoming these challenges. In summary, technological advancements will lead to a shift in the job market, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. To adapt, individuals must be open to continuous learning, flexible, adaptable, and focused on improving their soft skills. Entrepreneurship can also help create new opportunities.",

        "answer": "- With the development of technology, jobs that do not require human factors, for example: bank tellers, accountants, factory workers, even programmers will be replaced by machines and AI. This certainly makes sense and is profitable, considering that AI requires less salary and rest time than human workers, and can make fewer mistakes. If we do not act quickly, the human workers who are replaced will be unemployed. - New business opportunities are starting to emerge, such as online shops, content creators, and others. If we follow this trend, the possibility of losing jobs can be overcome. Another thing that can be added to yourself is soft skills, which of course will be a consideration for management in recruiting employees.",

        "answer": "With the development of AI, all jobs can be replaced by robots. What is already clearly visible is the machines in industrial factories. Where in the past a factory would require a lot of workers to work on it. But now, with the presence of robots, the work process in the factory does not require many people. Only a supervisor is needed to run the machine. In addition, the use of robots can also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of work in the factory and can improve quality because robots are programmed to produce products with the same quality. This is what reduces the work of factory workers. On the other hand, the tools in the factory require officers to keep the tools running, maintain them and so on so that new types of jobs related to the AI \u200b\u200btools will emerge. We must be humans who develop, not stop at what is currently available but follow the flow of development.

        "answer": "Work that is repetitive and monotonous can be replaced by machines, for example jobs related to machines such as factory workers, over time their jobs can be replaced by machines. The use of machines is something that is profitable because machines do not need to be treated like humans, they do not need work insurance, they do not need to be paid salaries and benefits, and other reasons. As a result, it is likely that new types of jobs will emerge as compensation for the replacement of human labor with machine labor in order to continue to open up employment opportunities for the community. In my opinion, it is very likely that the jobs that emerge will also be related to the use of these machines, for example the people who operate them, create the systems or machines, there could even be a special sector in government which is tasked with regulating regulations regarding the power of these machines. Attitude and strategy: Be prepared to be able to adapt to all possibilities that will occur. Don't close yourself off to change, because every change that occurs will definitely have a positive impact that we can feel. We must be willing to adapt and develop ourselves so that we can fit in this new environment.

Velocity, refers to the speed of data when created in real-time, data movement or data arrangement. Big data is able to process and analyze data while it is being used without having to place it in a database. Variety, big data can store data from various types of text data, video images, emails, etc. and from various sources too. In other words, Big data can store both structured, unstructured and semistructured data.  Value is the value of a piece of data. Value data is useful when we make decisions after analyzing existing data.  Veracity relates to whether data is valid or not and whether it can be trusted or not.

        "answer": "Big data is a term that is usually used to describe large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured. Big data has characteristics or criteria called 5V, namely volume, velocity, variety, varicity, and value. 1. Volume: The volume characteristic in big data shows a very large volume that can be generated every day from various sources, for example from social media platforms, networks, and others that are stored in a data warehouse. 2. Velocity: The velocity characteristic in big data refers to the speed of data transfer, data compilation, and the speed of data typing created in real time. 3. Variety: The variety characteristic in big data shows that data of various types can be grouped into a structured database. 4. Varicity: The varicity characteristic in big data refers to the validity of the data. Because big data can help analyze various types of data in large volumes so that the amount of data does not make the information obtained less valid. 5. Value: The value characteristic in big data shows that the data produced also has value. Data value can be used to determine decisions or the next steps to be taken.",
