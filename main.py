"question": "What are the 3 differences between a relational database and a data warehouse?",
"score": 5,
"reasoning": "The student mentions two clear differences between relational databases and data warehouses:
1. Purpose: The student correctly states that relational databases are used for Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) but can also be used for other purposes such as Data Warehousing, while data warehouses are the second stage where data is no longer queried in large quantities and has been aggregated and denormalized for analysis.
2. Data Structure: Although the student does not explicitly mention the data structure difference (relational databases use a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns requiring a predefined schema, while data warehouses organize data in a format optimal for querying and analysis), they do imply this difference by stating that relational databases have complicated tables and joins due to normalization, which is done to reduce redundant data and save storage space. Data warehouses, on the other hand, denormalize data for efficient querying and analysis.

Therefore, the student's answer meets the requirements of the rubric (mentioning two or more differences between relational databases and data warehouses with correct and concise explanations)."
